<p class='c015'>In this volume the text of Bülg has not
been followed over-scrupulously: but it is
hoped that, in a book intended for general
circulation, none will deplore such excisions
and euphemisms, nor even such slight
additions, as seemed to make for coherence
and clarity and decorum.</p>

<p class='c016'>The curious are referred to the pages of
<i>Poictesme en Chanson et Légende</i> for a
discussion of the sources of <i>The Silver
Stallion</i>; and may decide for themselves
whether or not Bülg has, in Codman’s
phrase, “shown” these legends to be “spurious
compositions of 17th century origin.”
For myself, I here confess to finding the
evidence educed, alike, a bit inadequate and,
as far as goes my purpose, wholly immaterial.
These chronicles, such as they are,
present the only known record of the latter
days of champions whose youthful exploits
have long since been made familiar to English
readers of Lewistam’s <i>Popular Tales
of Poictesme</i>: authentic or not, and irrespective
of whether such legends cannot be
quite definitely proved to have existed earlier
than 1652, here is the sole account we
have anywhere, or are now likely ever to
receive, of the changes that followed in
Poictesme after the passing of Manuel the
Redeemer.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is as such an account—which for my
purpose was a desideratum,—that I have
put <i>The Silver Stallion</i> into English.</p>

<p class='c003'>THE LORDS THAT POICTESME HAD IN DOM MANUEL’S TIME</p>

</div>
<p class='c018'><i>These ten were of the Fellowship of the Silver Stallion</i>:</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Dom Manuel</i>, Count of Poictesme, held Storisende and
Bellegarde, the town of Beauvillage and the strong fort
at Lisuarte, with all Amneran and Morven.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Messire Gonfal of Naimes</i>, Margrave of Aradol, held
Upper Naimousin.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Messire Donander of Évre</i>, the Thane of Aigremont,
held Lower Naimousin.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Messire Kerin of Nointel</i>, Syndic and Castellan of
Basardra, held West Val-Ardray.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Messire Ninzian of Yair</i>, the High Bailiff of Upper
Ardra, held Val-Ardray in the East.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Messire Holden of Nérac</i>, Earl Marshal of St. Tara,
held Belpaysage.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Messire Anavalt of Fomor</i>, the Portreeve and Warden
of Manneville, held Belpaysage Le Bas.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Messire Coth of the Rocks</i>, Alderman of St. Didol,
held Haut Belpaysage.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Messire Guivric of Perdigon</i>, Heitman of Asch, held
Piemontais.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Messire Miramon of Ranec</i>, Lord Seneschal of Gontaron,
held Duardenois.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c008' />
</div>
<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>Likewise there were the fiefs of Dom Meunier, Count
of Montors, Dom Manuel’s brother-in-law. Meunier was
not of this fellowship: he held also Giens. Here his wife
ruled over Lower Duardenois.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Othmar Black-Tooth</i>, whom some called Othmar the
Lawless, long held Valnères and Ogde, until Manuel
routed him: thereafter these villages, with the most of
Bovion, stayed masterless.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>¶ Helmas the Deep-Minded</i>, after a magic was put upon
him in the year of grace 1255, held, in his fashion, the
high place at Brunbelois: but the rest of Acaire, once
Lorcha had been taken and Sclaug burned, was no man’s
land. Also upon Upper Morven lived disaffected persons
in defiance of all law and piety.</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THEY relate how Dom Manuel that was the
high Count of Poictesme, and was everywhere
esteemed the most lucky and the least scrupulous
rogue of his times, had disappeared out of his castle
at Storisende, without any reason or forewarning,
upon the feast day of St. Michael and All the Angels.
They tell of the confusion and dismay which arose in
Dom Manuel’s lands when it was known that Manuel
the Redeemer—thus named because he had redeemed
Poictesme from the Northmen, through the aid of
Miramon Lluagor, with a great and sanguinary magic,—was
now gone, quite inexplicably, out of these lands.</p>

<p class='c005'>For whither Manuel had gone, no man nor any
woman could say with certainty. At Storisende he
had last been seen by his small daughter Melicent, who
stated that Father, mounted on a black horse, had ridden
westward with Grandfather Death, on a white one,
to a far place beyond the sunset. This was quite generally
felt to be improbable.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet further inquiry had but made more deep the
mystery as to the manner of Dom Manuel’s passing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Further inquiry had disclosed that the only human eyes
anywhere which had, or could pretend to have, rested
upon Dom Manuel after Manuel had left Storisende
were those of a little boy called Jurgen, the son of Coth
of the Rocks. Young Jurgen, after having received
from his father an in no way unusual whipping, had
run away from home, and had not been recaptured until
the following morning. The lad reported that during
his wanderings he had witnessed, toward dusk, upon
Upper Morven, a fearful eucharist in which the Redeemer
of Poictesme had very horribly shared. Thereafter—so
the child’s tale ran,—had ensued a transfiguration,
and a prediction as to the future of Poictesme,
and Dom Manuel’s elevation into the glowing clouds
of sunset....</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, these latter details had been, at their first rendering,
blubbered almost inarticulately. For, after just
the initiatory passages of this supposed romance, the
parents of Jurgen, in their first rapturous relief at having
recovered their lost treasure, had, of course, in the
manner of parents everywhere, resorted to such moral
altitudes and to such corporal corrections as had disastrously
affected the putative small liar’s tale. Then,
as the days passed, and they of Poictesme still vainly
looked for the return of their great Dom Manuel, the
child was of necessity questioned again: and little Jurgen,
after sulking for a while, had retold his story without
any detected deviation.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>It certainly all sounded quite improbable. Nevertheless,
here was the only explanation of the land’s loss
tendered anywhere by anybody: and people began half
seriously to consider it. Say what you might, this immature
and spanked evangelist had told a story opulent
in details which no boy of his age could well, it
seemed, have invented. Many persons therefore began
sagely to refer to the mouths of babes and sucklings,
and to nod ominously. Moreover, the child, when yet
further questioned, had enlarged upon Manuel’s last
prediction as to the future glories of Poictesme, to an
extent which made incredulity seem rather unpatriotic;
and Jurgen had amplified his horrific story of the
manner in which Manuel had redeemed his people from
the incurred penalties of their various sins up to and
including that evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>The suggested inference that there was to be no accounting
anywhere for one’s unavoidable misdemeanors
up to date,—among which Dom Manuel had been
at pains to specify such indiscretions as staying out all
night without your parents’ permission,—was an arrangement
which everybody, upon consideration, found
to be more and more desirable. Good-hearted persons
everywhere began, with virtually a free choice thus offered
between belief and disbelief, to prefer to invest a
little, it well might be, remunerative faith in the story
told with such conviction by this sweet and unsullied
child, rather than in the carping comments of materialists,—who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>after all, could only say, well out of earshot
of Coth of the Rocks, that this young Jurgen was
very likely to distinguish himself thereafter, either in
the pulpit or upon some gallows.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile one woeful fact was, in any case, undeniable:
the saga of that quiet, prospering grand thief
of a Manuel had ended with the inconsequent, if the
not actually incredible, tales of these two little children;
and squinting tall gray Manuel of the high head had
gone out of Poictesme, nobody could say whither.</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>AND meanwhile too the Redeemer’s wife, Dame
Niafer, had sent a summoning to each of the
nine lords that, with Manuel, were of the Fellowship
of the Silver Stallion: and all these met at
Storisende, as Niafer commanded them, for a session
or, as they more formally called it, a siege of this order.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now this fellowship took its name from the banner
it had fought under so destroyingly. Upon that sable
banner was displayed a silver stallion, which was rampant
in every member and was bridled with gold. Dom
Manuel was the captain of this fellowship; and it was
made up of the nine barons who, under Manuel, had
ruled Poictesme. Each had his two stout castles and
his fine woodlands and meadows, which he held in
fealty to Dom Manuel: and each had a high name for
valor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Four of these genial murderers had served, under
the Conde de Tohil Vaca, in Manuel’s first and utterly
disastrous campaign against the Northmen: but all the
nine had been with Manuel since the time of the great
fighting about Lacre Kai, and throughout Manuel’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>various troubles with Oribert and Thragnar and Earl
Ladinas and Sclaug and Oriander, that blind and coldly
evil Swimmer who was the father of Manuel; and in
all the other warrings of Manuel these nine had been
with him up to the end.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the deeds of the lords of the Silver Stallion had
fallen very little short of Manuel’s own deeds. Thus,
it was Manuel, to be sure, who killed Oriander: that
was a family affair. But Miramon Lluagor, the
Seneschal of Gontaron, was the champion who subdued
Thragnar and put upon him a detection and a hindrance:
and it was Kerin of Nointel—the Syndic and,
after that, the Castellan of Basardra,—who captured
and carefully burned Sclaug. Then, in the quelling of
Othmar Black-Tooth’s rebellion, Ninzian of Yair, the
High Bailiff of Upper Ardra, had killed eleven more
of the outlaws than got their deaths by Manuel’s sword.
It was Guivric of Perdigon, and not Manuel, who put
the great Arabian Al-Motawakkil out of life. And in
the famous battle with the Easterlings, by which the
city of Megaris was rescued, it was Manuel who got the
main glory and, people said, a three nights’ loan of the
body of King Theodoret’s young sister; but capable
judges declared the best fighting on that day was done
by Donander of Évre, then but a boy, whom Manuel
thereafter made Thane of Aigremont.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet Holden of Nérac, the Marshal of St. Tara, was
the boldest of them all, and was very well able to hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>his own in single combat with any of those that have
been spoken of: Coth of the Rocks had not ever quitted
any battle-field except as a conqueror: and courteous
Anavalt of Fomor and light-hearted Gonfal of
Naimes—who had the worst names among this company
for being the most cunning friends and coaxers of
women,—these two had put down their masculine opposers
also in gratifyingly large numbers.</p>

<p class='c005'>In fine, no matter where the lords of the Silver Stallion
had raised their banner against an adversary, it
was in that place they made an end of that adversary:
for there was never, in any time, a hardier gang of
bullies than was this Fellowship of the Silver Stallion
in the season that they kept earth noisy with the clashing
of their swords and darkened heaven with the
smoke of the towns they were sacking, and when
throughout the known world men had talked about the
wonders which these champions were performing with
Dom Manuel to lead them. Now they were leaderless.</p>

<p class='c005'>These heroes came to Storisende; and with Dame
Niafer they of course found Holy Holmendis. This
saint was then very lately come out of Philistia, to
console the Countess in her bereavement. But they
found with her also that youthful red-haired Horvendile
under whom Dom Manuel, in turn, had held
Poictesme, by the terms of a contract which was not
ever made public. Some said this Horvendile to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Satan’s friend and emissary, while others declared his
origin to lurk in a more pagan mythology: all knew
the boy to be a master of discomfortable strange magics
such as were unknown to Miramon Lluagor and
Guivric the Sage.</p>

<p class='c005'>This Horvendile said to the nine heroes, “Now begins
the last siege of the Fellowship of the Silver
Stallion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Donander of Évre was the youngest of them. Yet
he spoke now, piously and boldly enough. “But it is
our custom, Messire Horvendile, to begin each siege
with prayer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“This siege,” replied Horvendile, “must nevertheless
begin without any such religious side-taking. For this
is the siege in which, as it was prophesied, you shall
be both against Judah and against Jerusalem, and
against Thebes and Hermopolis and Avalon and Breidablik
and all other places which produce Redeemers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Upon my word, but who is master here!” cried Coth
of the Rocks, twirling at his long mustachios. This
gesture was a sure sign that trouble brewed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Horvendile answered: “The master who held Poictesme,
under my whims, has passed. A woman sits in
his place, his little son inherits after him. So begins
a new romance; and a new order is set afoot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet Coth, in his restless pursuit of variety, has
asked a wholly sensible question,” said Gonfal, the tall
Margrave of Aradol. “Who will command us, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>now will give us our directions? Can Madame Niafer
lead us to war?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“These things are separate. Dame Niafer commands:
but it is I—since you ask,—who will give to
all of you your directions, and your dooms too against
the time of their falling, and after that to your names
I will give life. Now, your direction, Gonfal, is
South.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Gonfal looked full at Horvendile, in frank surprise.
“I was already planning for the South, though certainly
I had told nobody about it. You are displaying,
Messire Horvendile, an uncomfortable sort of wisdom
which troubles me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Horvendile replied, “It is but a little knack of foresight,
such as I share with Balaam’s ass.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Gonfal stayed more grave than was his custom.
He asked, “What shall I find in the South?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What all men find, at last, in one place or another,
whether it be with the aid of a knife or of a rope or
of old age. Yet, I assure you, the finding of it will
not be unwelcome.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,”—Gonfal shrugged,—“I am a realist. I take
what comes, in the true form it comes in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Coth of the Rocks was blustering again. “I
also am a realist. Yet I permit no upstart, whether
he have or have not hair like a carrot, to give me any
directions.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Horvendile answered, “I say to you—”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>But Coth replied, shaking his great bald head: “No,
I will not be bulldozed in this way. I am a mild-mannered
man, but I will not tamely submit to be thus
browbeaten. I believe, too, that Gonfal was insinuating
I do not usually ask sensible questions!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nobody has attempted—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you not contradicting me to my face! What
is that but to call me a liar! I will not, I repeat, submit
to these continued rudenesses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was only saying—”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Coth was implacable. “I will take directions
from nobody who storms at me and who preserves no
dignity whatever in our hour of grief. For the rest,
the children agree in reporting that, whether he
ascended in a gold cloud or traveled more sensibly on
a black horse, Dom Manuel went westward. I shall
go west, and I shall fetch Dom Manuel back into Poictesme.
I shall, also, candidly advise him, when he returns
to ruling over us, to discourage the tomfooleries
and the ridiculous rages of all persons whose brains are
overheated by their hair.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let the West, then,” said Horvendile, very quietly,
“be your direction. And if the people there do not
find you so big a man as you think yourself, do not
you be blaming me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>These were his precise words. Coth himself conceded
the coincidence, long afterward....</p>

<p class='c005'>“I, Messire Horvendile, with your permission, am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>for the North,” said Miramon Lluagor. This sorcerer
alone of them was upon any terms of intimacy with
this Horvendile. “I have yet upon gray Vraidex my
Doubtful Castle, in which an undoubtable and a known
doom awaits me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is true,” replied Horvendile. “Let the keen
North and the cold edge of Flamberge be yours. But
you, Guivric, shall have the warm wise East for your
direction.”</p>

<p class='c005'>That allotment was uncordially received. “I am
comfortable enough in my home at Asch,” said Guivric
the Sage. “At some other time, perhaps— But, really
now, Messire Horvendile, I have in hand a number
of quite important thaumaturgies just at the present!
Your suggestion is most upsetting. I know of no need
for me to travel east.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“With time you will know of that need,” said Horvendile,
“and you will obey it willingly, and you will
go willingly to face the most pitiable and terrible of
all things.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric the Sage did not reply. He was too sage to
argue with people when they talked foolishly. He was
immeasurably too sage to argue with, of all persons,
Horvendile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet that,” observed Holden of Nérac, “exhausts
the directions: and it leaves no direction for the rest
of us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Horvendile looked at this Holden, who was with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>every reason named the Bold; and Horvendile smiled.
“You, Holden, already take your directions, in a picturesque
and secret manner, from a queen—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let us not speak of that!” said Holden, between a
smirk and some alarm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“—And you will be guided by her, in any event,
rather than by me. To you also, Anavalt of Fomor,
yet another queen will call resistlessly by and by, and
you, who are rightly named the Courteous, will deny
her nothing. So to Holden and to Anavalt I shall give
no directions, because it is uncivil to come between any
woman and her prey.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I,” said Kerin of Nointel, “I have at Ogde a
brand-new wife whom I prize above all the women I
ever married, and far above any mere crowned queen.
Not even wise Solomon,” now Kerin told them, blinking,
in a sort of quiet scholastic ecstasy, “when that
Judean took his pick of the women of this world, accompanied
with any queen like my Saraïde: for she is
in all ways superior to what the Cabalists record about
Queen Naäma, that pious child of the bloodthirsty King
of Ammon, and about Queen Djarada, the daughter of
idolatrous Nubara the Egyptian, and about Queen
Balkis, who was begotten by a Sheban duke upon the
person of a female Djinn in the appearance of a gazelle.
And only at the command of my dear Saraïde would
I leave home to go in any direction.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will, nevertheless, leave home, very shortly,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>declared Horvendile. “And it will be at the command
and at the personal urging of your Saraïde.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin leaned his head to one side, and he blinked
again. He had just Dom Manuel’s trick of thus opening
and shutting his eyes when he was thinking, but
Kerin’s mild dark gaze in very little resembled Manuel’s
piercing, vivid and rather wary consideration of affairs.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin then observed, “Yet it is just as Holden said,
and every direction is preëmpted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no,” said Horvendile. “For you, Kerin, will
go downward, whither nobody will dare to follow you,
and where you will learn more wisdom than to argue
with me, and to pester people with uncalled-for erudition.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It follows logically that I,” laughed young Donander
of Évre, “must be going upward, toward paradise
itself, since no other direction whatever remains.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That,” Horvendile replied, “happens to be true.
But you will go up far higher than you think for; and
your doom shall be the most strange of all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then must I rest content with some second-rate
and commonplace destruction?” asked Ninzian of Yair,
Who alone of the fellowship had not yet spoken.</p>

<p class='c005'>Horvendile looked at sleek Ninzian, and Horvendile
looked long and long. “Donander is a tolerably pious
person. But without Ninzian, the Church would lack
the stoutest and the one really god-fearing pillar it possesses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>anywhere in these parts. That would be the
devil of a misfortune. Your direction, therefore, is
to remain in Poictesme, and to uphold the edifying fine
motto of Poictesme, for the world’s benefit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But the motto of Poictesme,” said Ninzian, doubtfully,
“is <i>Mundus vult decipi</i>, and signifies that the
world wishes to be deceived.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is a highly moral sentiment, which I may
safely rely upon you alike to concede and prove. Therefore,
for you who are so pious, I shall slightly paraphrase
the Scripture: and I declare to all of you that
neither will I any more remove the foot of Ninzian
from out of the land which I have appointed for your
children; so that they will take heed to do all which
I have commanded them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That,” Ninzian said, looking markedly uncomfortable,
“is very delightful.”</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>3.</i><br /><i>How Anavalt Lamented the Redeemer</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THEN Madame Niafer arose, black-robed and
hollow-eyed, and she made a lament for Dom
Manuel, whose like for gentleness and purity
and loving kindliness toward his fellows she declared
to remain nowhere in this world. It was an encomium
under which the attendant warriors stayed very grave
and rather fidgety, because they recognized and shared
her grief, but did not wholly recognize the Manuel
whom she described to them.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the Fellowship of the Silver Stallion was decreed
to be disbanded, because of the law of Poictesme
that all things should go by tens forever. There was
no fighting-man able to fill Manuel’s place: and a fellowship
of nine members was, as Dame Niafer pointed
out, illegal.</p>

<p class='c005'>It well might be, however, she suggested, with a
side glance toward Holmendis, that some other peculiarly
holy person, even though not a warrior— At the
same instant Coth said, with a startling and astringent
decisiveness, “Bosh!”</p>

<p class='c005'>His confrères felt the gross incivility of this interruption,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>but felt, too, that they agreed with Coth. And
so the fellowship was proclaimed to be disbanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Anavalt of Fomor made a lament for the passing
of that noble order whose ranks were broken at
last, and for Dom Manuel also Anavalt raised a lament,
praising Manuel for his hardihood and his cunning
and his terribleness in battle. The heroes nodded
their assent to this more intelligible sort of talking.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Manuel,” said Anavalt, “was hardy. It was not
wise for any enemy to provoke him. When that indiscretion
was committed, Manuel made himself as a
serpent about the city of that enemy, girdling his prey
all round: he seized the purlieus of that city, and its
cattle, and its boats upon the rivers. He beleaguered
that city everywhere, he put fire to the orchards, he
silenced the mill-races, he prevented the plowers from
plowing the land; and the people of that city starved,
and they ate up one another, until the survivors chose
to surrender to Dom Manuel. Then Manuel raised his
gallows, he whistled in his headsmen, and there were
no more survivors of that people.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Anavalt said also: “Manuel was cunning. With
a feather he put a deception upon three kings, but the
queens that he played his tricks on were more than
three, nor was it any feather that he diddled them with.
Nobody could outwit Manuel. What he wanted he
took, if he could get it that way, with his strong hand:
but, if not, he used his artful head and his lazy, wheedling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>tongue, and his other members too, so that the
person whom he was deluding would give Manuel whatever
he required. It was like eating honey, to be deluded
by Manuel. I think it is no credit for a private
man to be a great rogue; but the leader of a people
must know how to deceive all peoples.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Anavalt said: “Manuel was terrible. There
was no softness in him, no hesitancy, and no pity.
That, too, is not a virtue in a private person, but in
the leader of a people it may well be a blessing for that
people. Manuel so ordered matters that no adversary
ever troubled Poictesme the second time. He lived as a
tyrant over us; but it is better to have one master that
you know the ways of than to be always changing
masters in a world where none but madmen run about
at their own will. I do not weep for Manuel, because
he would never have wept for me nor for anybody
else; but I regret that man of iron and the protection
he was to us who are not ruthless iron but flesh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a silence afterward. Yet still the heroes
nodded gravely. This was, in the main, a Manuel
whom they all recognized.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dame Niafer, however, had risen up a little way
from her seat, when the pious gaunt man Holy Holmendis,
who sat next to her, put out his hand to her
hand. After this she said nothing: yet it was perfectly
clear the Countess thought that Anavalt had been praising
Manuel for the wrong sort of virtues.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>A fire was kindled with that ceremony which was
requisite. The banner of the great fellowship was
burned, and the lords of the Silver Stallion now broke
their swords, and they cast these fragments also into
this fire, so that these swords might never defend any
other standard. It was the youth of these nine men
and the first vigor and faith of their youth which perished
with the extinction of that fire: and they knew it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thereafter the heroes left Storisende. Each rode
for his own home, and they made ready, each in his
own fashion, for that new order of governance which
with the passing of Dom Manuel had come upon Poictesme.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW Guivric and Donander and Gonfal rode
westward with their attendants, all in one company,
as far as Guivric’s home at Asch. And
as these three lords rode among the wreckage and the
gathering fogs of November, the three talked together.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a pity,” said Gonfal of Naimes, “that, while
our little Count Emmerick is growing up, this land
must now be ruled by a lame and sallow person, who
had never much wit and who tends already to stringiness.
Otherwise, in a land ruled over by a widow,
who is used to certain recreations, one might be finding
amusement, and profit too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come now,” said loyal Donander of Évre, “but
Madame Niafer is a chaste and good woman who means
well!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She has yet another quality which is even more
disastrous in the ruler of any country,” returned Guivric
the Sage.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what hook have you found now to hang a
cynicism on?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I fear more from her inordinate piety than from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>her indifferent looks and her stupid well-meaningness.
That woman will be reforming things everywhere into
one gray ruin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed,” said Gonfal, smiling, “these rising fogs
have to me very much the appearance of church incense.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric nodded. “Yes. Had it been possible, I believe
that Madame Niafer would have preserved and
desecrated the fellowship by setting in Dom Manuel’s
place that Holy Holmendis who is nowadays her guide
in all spiritual matters; and who will presently, do you
mark my prophesying, be making a sanctimonious hash
of her statecraft.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He composed for her, it is well known,” said Gonfal,
“the plaint which she made for Dom Manuel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That was a cataloguing of ecclesiastic virtues,”
Guivric said, dryly, “which to my mind did not very
immediately suggest the tall adulterer and parricide
whom we remember. This Holmendis has, thus, already
brought hypocrisy into fashion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He will be Niafer’s main counselor,” Gonfal speculated.
“He is a pushing, vigorous fellow. I wonder
now—?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric nodded again. “Women prefer to take counsel
in a bedchamber,” he stated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, Guivric,” put in pious young Donander of
Évre. “Come now, whatever his over-charitable opinion
of our dead master, this Holmendis is a saint: and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>we true believers should speak no ill of the saints.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have nothing against belief, nor hypocrisy either,
within reason, nor have I anything against saints, in
their proper place. It is only that should a saint—and
more particularly, a saint conceived and nurtured and
made holy in Philistia,—ever come to rule over Poictesme,
and over the bedchamber of Dom Manuel,” said
Guivric, moodily, “that saint would not be in his proper
place. And our day, my friends, would be ended.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is already ended,” Gonfal said, “so far as Poictesme
is concerned: these fogs smell over-strongly of
church incense. But these fogs which rise about Poictesme
do not envelop the earth. For one, I shall fare
south, as that Horvendile directed me, and as I had already
planned to do. In the South I shall find nobody
so amusing as that fine great squinting quiet scoundrel
of a Manuel. Yet in the South there is a quest cried
for the hand of Morvyth, the dark Queen of Inis
Dahut; and, now that my wife is dead, it may be that
I would find it amusing to sleep with this young queen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The others laughed, and thought no more of the
light boastfulness of this Gonfal who was the world’s
playfellow. But within the month it was known that
Gonfal of Naimes, the Margrave of Aradol, had in
truth quitted his demesnes, and had traveled southward.
And he was the first of this famous fellowship, after
Dom Manuel, to go out of Poictesme, not ever to return.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the tale is of how Gonfal fared in the
South, where the people were Fundamentalists.
It is told how the quest was cried; and how,
in the day’s fashion, the hand of Morvyth, the dark
Queen of Inis Dahut and of the four other Isles of
Wonder, was promised to the champion who should
fetch back the treasure that was worthiest to be her
bridal gift. Eight swords, they say, were borne to the
altar of Pygé-Upsízugos, to be suitably consecrated,
after a brief and earnest address, by the Imaun of Bulotu.
Eight appropriately ardent lovers raised high
these swords, to swear fealty to Queen Morvyth and to
the quest of which her loveliness was the reward. Thus
all was as it should be, until they went to sheathe these
swords. Then, one champion among the company,
striking his elbow against his neighbor, had, rather unaccountably,
the ill luck to drop his sword so that it
pierced his own left foot.</p>

<p class='c005'>The horns sounded afterward, through the narrow
streets and over the bronze and lacquer roofs, and
seven of Queen Morvyth’s suitors armed and rode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>forth to ransack the world of its chief riches for a year
and a day.</p>

<p class='c005'>He who did not ride with the others was Gonfal of
Naimes. It was three months, indeed, before his
wound was so healed that Gonfal could put foot to
stirrup. And by that time, he calculated regretfully,
the riches of the world must have been picked over
with such thoroughness that it would hardly be worth
while for a cripple to be hobbling out to make himself
ridiculous among unsympathetic strangers. His agony,
as he admitted, under this inclement turn of chance,
was well-nigh intolerable; yet nothing was to be gained
by blinking the facts: and Gonfal was, as he also admitted,
a realist.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gonfal, thus, remained at court through the length
of a year, and lived uneventfully in the pagan Isles of
Wonder. Gonfal sat unsplendidly snug while all his
rivals rode at adventure in the meadows that are most
fertile in magic and ascended the mountains that rise
beyond plausibility in the climates most favorable to the
unimaginable. But Gonfal’s sufficing consolation appeared
to be that he sat, more and more often, with the
Queen.</p>

<p class='c005'>However, the Margrave of Aradol, alone of Morvyth’s
suitors, had overpassed his first youth; the aging
seem to acquire a sort of proficiency in being disappointed,
and to despatch the transaction with more ease:
and so, Queen Morvyth speculated, the Margrave of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Aradol could perhaps endure this cross of unheroic
tranquillity—even over and above his natural despair,
now he had lost all hope of winning her,—with an
ampler fortitude than would have been attainable by
any of the others.</p>

<p class='c005'>Besides, their famousness was yet to be won, their
exploits stayed, as yet, resplendent and misty magnets
which drew them toward the future. But this Gonfal,
who had come into Inis Dahut after so much notable
service under Manuel of Poictesme and the unconquerable
banner of the Silver Stallion, had in his day, the
young Queen knew, been through eight formal wars,
with any amount of light guerrilla work. He had slain
his satisfactory quota of dragons and usurpers and
ogres, and, also some years ago, had married the golden-haired
and starry-eyed and swan-throated princess
who is the customary reward of every champion’s faithful
attendance to derring-do.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, in the afternoon of Gonfal’s day, with his
princess dead, and with the realms that he had shared
with her all lost,—and with his overlord Count Manuel
too departed from this world, and with the banner
of the Silver Stallion no longer followed by any one,—now
this tall Gonfal went among his fellows in Inis
Dahut a little aloofly. Yet the fair-bearded man went
smilingly, too, as one who amuses himself at a game
which he knows to be not very important: for he was,
as he said, a realist, even in the pagan Isles of Wonder.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>And Morvyth, the dark Queen of the five Isles of
Wonder, was annoyed by the bantering ways of her
slow-spoken lover; she did not like these ways: she
would put out of mind the question whether this man
was being bitterly amused by his own hopeless infatuation
or by something—incredible as that seemed,—about
her. But that question would come back into her
mind: and Morvyth, with an habitual light lovely gesture,
would tidy the hair about her ears, and would
go again to talk with Gonfal, so that she might, privately
and just for her own satisfaction, decide upon
this problem. Besides, the man had rather nice eyes.</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>6.</i><br /><i>The Loans of Power</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW, when the year was over, and when the
bland persistent winds of April had won up
again out of the South, the heroes returned,
each with his treasure. Each brought to Morvyth a
bridal gift as miraculous as the adventures through
which it had been come by: and all these adventures
had been marvelous beyond any easy believing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Indeed, as the Queen remarked, in private, their tales
were hardly credible.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And yet, I think, these buoyant epics are based upon
fact,” replied Gonfal. “Each of these men is the
shrewd, small and ill-favored third son of a king. It
is the law that such unprepossessing midgets should
prosper, and override every sort of evil, in the Isles
of Wonder and all other extra-mundane lands.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But is it fair, my friend, is it even respectful, to the
august and venerable powers of iniquity, that these
whippersnappers—?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Gonfal replied: “Nobody contends, I assure you,
that such easy conquests are quite sportsmanlike. Nevertheless,
they are the prerogatives of the third son of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>a king. So, as a realist, madame, I perforce concede
that fortune, hereabouts, regards these third sons with
a fixed grin of approval. Even foxes and ants and
ovens and broomsticks put aside their customary taciturnity,
to favor these royal imps with invaluable advice:
all giants and three-headed serpents must, I daresay,
confront them with a half-guilty sense of committing
felo-de-se: and at every turn of the road waits an
enamored golden-haired princess.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now not every one of these truisms appeared, to the
dark eyes of Morvyth, wholly satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Blondes do not last,” said Morvyth, “and I am a
queen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is true,” Gonfal admitted. “I am not certain
every third prince prospers with a queen. I can recall
no authority upon the point.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My friend, there is not any doubt that these dauntless
champions have prospered everywhere. And it is
another trouble for me now to decide which one has
fetched back the treasure that is worthiest to be my
bridal gift.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Gonfal pursed up his remarkably red and soft-looking
lips. He regarded the young Queen for a brief
while, and throughout that while he wore his odd air
of considering an amusing matter which was of no
great importance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Madame,” Gonfal then said, “I would distinguish.
To be worthiest, a thing must first be worthy.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>At this the slender brows of Morvyth went up. “But
upon that ebony table, my friend, are potent magics
which control all the wealth of the world.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not dispute that. I merely marvel—as a perhaps
unpractical realist,—how such wealth can be
termed a gift, when it at utmost is but a loan.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now do you tell me,” commanded Morvyth, “just
what that means!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Gonfal before replying considered for a while
the trophies which were the increment of his younger,
smaller and more energetic rivals’ heroism. These trophies
were, indeed, sufficiently remarkable.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, for one thing,—fetched from the fiery heart of
the very dreadful seven-walled city of Lankha, by bustling
little Prince Chedric of Lorn, after an infinity of
high exploits,—was that agate which had in the years
that are long past preserved the might of the old emperors
of Macedon. Upon this strange jewel were to
be seen a naked man and nine women, portrayed in the
agate’s veinings: and this agate assured its wearer of
victory in every battle. The armies of the pagan Isles
of Wonder would be ready, at the first convenient
qualm of patriotism or religious faith, to lay waste
and rob all the wealthiest kingdoms in that part of
the world, should Morvyth choose that agate as her
bridal gift.</p>

<p class='c005'>And yet Gonfal, as he now put it aside, spoke rather
sadly, and said only, “Bunkhum!” in one or another of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the foreign tongues which he had acquired during his
mundivagant career of knight-errantry.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gonfal then looked at an onyx. It was the onyx of
Thossakan. Its wearer had the power to draw out the
soul of any person, even of himself, and to imprison
that soul as a captive inside this hollowed onyx; and its
wearer might thus trample anywhither resistlessly. Beyond
the somber gleaming of this onyx showed the
green lusters of an emerald, which was engraved with
a lyre and three bees, with a dolphin and the head of a
bull. Misfortune and failure of no sort could enter
into the house wherein was this Samian gem. But the
brightest of all the ensorcelled stones arrayed upon the
ebony table was the diamond of Luned, whose wearer
might at will go invisible: and to this Cymric wonder
Gonfal accorded the tribute of a shrug.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This diamond,” said Gonfal then, “is a gift which
a well-balanced person might loyally tender to his queen,
but hardly to his prospective wife. I speak as a widower,
madame: and I assure you that Prince Duneval
of Orc we may dismiss from our accounting, as a too
ardent lover of danger.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Morvyth thought this very clever and naughty and
cynical of him, but smilingly said nothing. And Gonfal
touched the offering of pompous little Thorgny of
Vigeois. This was the gray sideritis, which, when
bathed in running waters and properly propitiated, told
with the weak voice of an infant whatever you desired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>to learn. The secrets of war and statecraft, of all that
had ever happened anywhere, and of all arts and trades,
were familiar to the wearer of the gray sideritis. And
Gonfal touched, more gingerly, the moonstone of Naggar
Tura, whose cutting edge no material substance
could resist, so that the strong doors of an adversary’s
treasure house, or the walls of his fortified city, could
be severed with this gem just as a knife slices an apple.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet equally marvelous, in another fashion, was this
moonstone’s neighbor, a jewel of scarlet radiancy
streaked with purple. All that was needed to ensure a
prosperous outcome of whatsoever matter one had in
hand could be found engraved upon this stone, in the
lost color called tingaribinus. For the wearer of this
stone—a fragment, as the most reputable cantraps attested,
of the pillar which Jacob raised at Beth-El,—it
was not possible to fail in any sort of worldly endeavor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet Gonfal put this too aside, speaking again in a
foreign language unfamiliar to Morvyth, and saying,
“Hohkum!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And then, but not until then, Gonfal answered Queen
Morvyth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean,” he said, “that with my own eyes I have
seen that sturdy knave Dom Manuel attain to the summit
of human estate, and thence pass, bewilderingly,
into nothingness. I mean that, through the virtues of
these amulets and periapts and other very dreadful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>manifestations of lithomancy, a monarch may retain,
for a longer season than did Manuel, much money and
acreage and all manner of power, and may keep all
these fine things for a score or for two-score or even
for three-score of years. But not for four-score years,
madame: for by that time the riches and the honors of
this world must fall away from every mortal man; and
all that can remain of the greatest emperor or of the
most dreadful conqueror will be, when four-score years
are over, picked bones in a black box.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Gonfal said also: “Such is now the estate of
Alexander, for all that he once owned this agate.
Achilles, who wore the sideritis and was so notable at
Troy, is master of no larger realm. And to Augustus
and Artaxerxes and Attila—here to proceed no further
in the alphabet,—quite similar observations apply.
These men went very ardently about this earth, the
vigor of their misconduct was truly heroic, and the
sound of their names is become as deathless as is the
sound of the wind. But once that four-score years
were over, their worldly power had passed as the dust
passes upon the bland and persistent wind which now
is come up out of the South to bring new life into Inis
Dahut, but to revive nothing that is dead. Just so must
always pass all worldly honors, as just such dust.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Gonfal said: “Just so—with my own eyes,—I
have seen Dom Manuel tumbled from the high estate
which that all-overtrampling rogue had purchased and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>held so unscrupulously; and I have seen his powerfulness
made dust. These occasional triumphs of justice,
madame, turn one to serious thinking.... Therefore
it seems to me that these questing gentlemen are offering
you no gift, but only a loan. I perforce consider—as
a realist, and with howsoever appropriate regret,—that
the conditions of the quest have not been fulfilled.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Queen deliberated his orotundities. And she
regarded Gonfal with a smile which now was like his
smiling, and which appeared not very immediately connected
with the trituration they were speaking of.</p>

<p class='c005'>Morvyth said then: “That is true. Your mathematics
are admirable, in that they combine resistlessly the
pious and the platitudinous. There is no well-thought-of
Fundamentalist in Inis Dahut, nor in any
of the Isles of Wonder, who will dare dispute that the
riches of this world are but a loan, because that is the
doctrine of Pygé-Upsízugos and of all endowed religions
everywhere. These over-busy, pushing ugly little
pests that ride impertinently about the world, and
get their own way in every place, have insulted me.
By rights,”—the Queen said, rather hopefully,—“by
rights, I ought to have their heads chopped off?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But these heroic imps are princes, madame. Thus,
to pursue your very natural indignation, would entail
a war with their fathers: and to be bothered with seven
wars, according to my mathematics, would be a nuisance.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Morvyth saw the justice of this; and said, with ever
so faint a sighing: “Very well, then! I approve of
your mathematics. I shall pardon their impudence,
with the magnanimity becoming to a queen; and I shall
have the quest cried for another year and another day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That,” Gonfal estimated, still with his odd smiling,
“will do nicely.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And, besides,” she added, “now you will have a
chance with the others!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That,” Gonfal assented, without any trace of a
smile or any other token of enthusiasm, “will be splendid.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Morvyth smiled as, with that habitual gesture,
she tidied her hair: and she sent for her seven heroic
lovers, and spoke to them, as she phrased it, frankly.</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>7.</i><br /><i>Fatality the Second</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THUS all was to do again. The champions
pulled rather long faces, and the lower orders
were disappointed in missing the gratis entertainments
attendant on a royal marriage. But the
clergy and the well-thought-of laity and the leading
tax-payers applauded the decision of Queen Morvyth
as a most glorious example in such feverish and pleasure-loving
days of soulless materialism.</p>

<p class='c005'>So again the eight lovers of Morvyth met in the
cathedral, to have their swords appropriately consecrated
by the Imaun of Bulotu. And that beneficent
and justly popular old prelate, after he had cut the
throats of the three selected children, began the real
ceremony with a prayer to Pygé-Upsízugos, as to Him
whose transformations are hidden in all temples patronized
by the best-thought-of people, and saying, as was
customary and polite:</p>

<p class='c005'>“The height of the firmament is subservient unto
thee, O Pygé-Upsízugos! thy throne is very high! the
ornaments upon the seat of thy blue trousers are the
bright stars which never diminish! Every man makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>offering unto that portion of thee which is revealed,
and thou art the Sedentary Master commemorated in
heaven and upon earth. Thou art a shining noble
seated above all nobles, permanent in thy high station,
established in thy stern sovereignty, and the callipygous
Prince of the Company of Gods.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Nobody quite believed this, of course, but in Inis
Dahut, as in all other places, the Fundamentalists took
a proper pride in their tribal deity, and, whenever they
could spare time for religious matters, made as much
of him as possible. So they now tendered to Pygé-Upsízugos
a fine offering of quails and cinnamon and
bullocks’ hearts, and they raised the Hymn of the Star
Spangled Buttock in the while that the two ewers containing
the blood of the children were placed upon his
altar.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus everything at first went nicely enough. But
when the company of Morvyth’s lovers, with all their
swords drawn, had approached the altar, for the consecrating,
and in the while that they ascended the smooth
porphyry steps, then limping Gonfal stumbled or else
he slipped. He thus dropped his sword. The tall champion,
clutching hastily at this sword as it fell, caught
up the weapon by the newly sharpened blade; and he
grasped it with such rather unaccountable vigor that he
cut open his right hand to the bone, and cut also the
muscles of his fingers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Decidedly,” said Gonfal, with a wried smile, “there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>is some fatality in this; and the quest of Morvyth is not
for me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He spoke the truth, for his sword-bearing days were
over. Gonfal must seek for a physician and bandages,
while his rivals’ swords were being consecrated. The
Queen noted his going, and, from a point midway between
complacence and religious scruples, said under
her breath, “One must perforce somewhat admire this
realist.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She heard, from afar, a dwindling resonance of
horns and knew that once more the seven heroic lovers
of Queen Morvyth had ridden forth to ransack the
world of its chief riches. But fair-bearded Gonfal
stayed in the pagan Isles of Wonder, and beneath the
same roof that covered Morvyth, and cared for no
riches except the loveliness of Morvyth, whom he saw
daily. And with time the hurt in his hand was cured,
but the fingers on that hand he could not ever move
again. And for the rest, if people whispered here and
there, the susurrus was a phenomenon familiar enough
to the economy of court life.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW, when the year was over, and the south
wind was come again into Inis Dahut, the seven
lovers returned, bringing with them yet other
prodigies acquired by heroic exploits.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, for example, was the effigy of a bird carved in
jade and carnelian.</p>

<p class='c005'>“With the aid of this inestimable bird,” explained
Prince Chedric of Lorn,—who, upon a very dreadfully
inhabited peninsula, if one elected to believe him, had
wrested this talisman from Morskoï of the Depths,—“you
may enter the Sea Market, and may go freely
among a folk that dwell in homes builded of coral and
tortoise-shell, and tiled with fishes’ scales. Their wisdom
is beyond the dry and arid wisdom of earth: their
knowledge derides the fictions which we call time and
space: and their children prattle of mysteries unknown
to any of our major prophets and most expert geomancers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, but,” cried Prince Balein of Targamon, “but I
have here a smoke-colored veil embroidered with tiny
gold stars and ink-horns; and it enables one to pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>through the ardent gateway of Audela, the country
that lies behind the fire. This is the realm of Sesphra:
there is no grieving in this land, and happiness and infallibility
are common to everybody there, because Sesphra
is the master of an art which corrodes and sears
away all error, whether it be human or divine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Prince Duneval of Orc said nothing. His mutely
tendered offering was a small mirror about three inches
square. Morvyth looked into this mirror: and what
she saw in it was very little like a sumptuous dark
young girl. She hastily put aside that gleaming and
over-wise counselor: and the Queen’s face was troubled,
because there was no need to ask what mirror
Duneval had fetched to her from out of Antan.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Thorgny of Vigeois did not love silence. And
he was the next suitor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such knickknacks as I notice at your feet, my princess,”
stated Thorgny of Vigeois, “have their merits.
Nobody denies their merits. But I, who may now address
you with the frankness which ought to exist between
two persons already virtually betrothed, I bring
that sigil which gave wisdom and all power to Apollonius,
and later to Merlin Ambrosius. It displays, as
you observe, an eye encircled with scorpions and stags
and”—he coughed,—“with winged objects which do not
ordinarily have wings: and it controls the nine million
spirits of the air. I need say no more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I need to,” said Prince Gurguint. “I say that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>have here the shining triangle of Thorston. And to
say that, is to say a great deal more than Thorgny has
said. For this triangle is master of the wisdom of the
Duergar and of all peoples that dwell underground.
Moreover, madame, when this triangle is inverted—thus,—it
enables you to bless and curse at will, to converse
with dead priests, and to control the power and
the seven mysteries of the moon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To such hole and corner wisdom, to such cave-men
devices, and more especially to your lunar vaporings,
I cry out like a bird upon the house-tops, and I cry,
Cheap, cheap!” observed Prince Clofurd. “For I have
here, in this shagreen case, the famous and puissant and
unspeakably sacrosanct ring of Solomon, to whose
wearer are subject the Djinns and the ass-footed Nazi-keen
and fourteen of Jahveh’s most discreet and trustworthy
seraphim.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Prince Grimauc said: “Solomon had, in his archaic
way, his wisdom, a good enough sort of workaday wisdom,
but yet a limited wisdom, as it was meted out to
him by the god of Judea: but I have here an altar
carved from a block of selenite. Within this altar you
may hear the moving and the dry rustlings of an immortal.
Let us not speak of this immortal: neither the
sun’s nor the moon’s light has ever shone upon him,
and his name is not lovable. But here is the Altar of
the Adversary; and the owner of this little altar may,
at a paid price, have access to the wisdom that defies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>restraint and goes beyond the bounds permitted by any
god.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Such were the gifts they brought to Morvyth. And,
for reasons of at least two kinds, the Queen found
difficulty in saying which of these offerings was the
worthiest to be her bridal gift.</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>9.</i><br /><i>The Loans of Wisdom</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>BUT Gonfal, when the Queen consulted him in
private, as she was now apt to do about most
matters, tall handsome Gonfal shrugged. He
said that, to his finding,—as a, no doubt, unpractical
realist,—her lovers had, once more, fetched back no
gifts, but only loans of very dubious value.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For I have seen Dom Manuel purchase a deal of
just such wisdom from unwholesome sources: and I
have seen too what came of it when the appointed season
was at hand for that gray knave to be stripped of
his wisdom. Just so, madame, must every sort of wisdom
be reft away from everybody. These wise men
that had all this knowledge in the old time, do they
retain it now? The question is absurd, since the dirt
that once was Solomon keeps no more sentiency than
does the mud which formerly was Solomon’s third
under-scullion. Indomitable persons have, before to-day,
won to the wisdom of Audela or of the Sea Market;
and that Freydis with whom Dom Manuel
lived for a while in necromantic iniquity, and that unscriptural
Herodias who was Tana’s daughter, these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>women, once, attained to the wisdom of Antan: but
might they carry any of this wisdom into the grave?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I see,” said Morvyth, reflectively; and she smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Equally,” Gonfal continued, “where now is your
Thorston or your Merlin? All which to-day remains
of any one of these thaumaturgists may well, at this
very instant, be passing us as dust in that bland and
persistent wind which now courses over Inis Dahut:
but the mage goes undiscerned, unhonored, impotent,
and goes as the wind wills, not as he elects. Ah, no,
madame! These quaint, archaic toys may for a little
while lend wisdom and understanding: but, none the
less, within four-score of years—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, have done with your arithmetic!” she begged
of him. “It serves handily, and I approve of your
mathematics. I really do consider it is perfectly wonderful,
sweetheart, how quickly you realists can think
of suitable truisms. But, just the same, I begin to
dislike that wind: and I would much rather talk about
something else.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let us talk about, then,” Gonfal said, “the different
way I feel concerning you, as compared with all
other women.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is not a new topic. But it is invariably interesting.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So they discussed this matter at some length. Then
they went on to other matters. And Morvyth asked
Gonfal if he was sure that he respected her just as much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>as ever, and Morvyth tidied her hair, and she summoned
the Imaun of Bulotu, and sent also for Masu
the prime minister.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The wisdom of this world is as a dust that passes,”
said Morvyth. “The wise men that had wisdom in
the old time, do they retain it now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She then repeated the rest of Gonfal’s observations
with applaudable accuracy.</p>

<p class='c005'>And her hearers did applaud, in unfeigned emotion.
“For this prying into matters which Pygé-Upsízugos
has not seen fit to reveal has always seemed to me
unwholesome,” remarked the prime minister.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In fact, the claims of science, so-called—” began the
Imaun; and spoke for the usual twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c005'>All was thus settled edifyingly. The offerings of
the kings’ sons were decreed to be no true gifts; the
quest was cried again; and once more the seven champions
rode forth. There was no thought of tall Gonfal
going with the little heroes, for a cripple who could
not bear a sword was not fitted to ransack the treasures
of the world. Instead, fair-bearded Gonfal stayed in
Inis Dahut, and lived uneventfully in the pagan Isles
of Wonder. And if people now talked outright, a
queen can never hope to go wholly free of criticism.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>
  <h2 class='c028'><i>10.</i><br /><i>Relative to Gonfal’s Head</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>IT followed through the two mischances already recorded
that, when spring came again, and when
once more the south wind was coursing over Inis
Dahut, Gonfal of Naimes sat, as it happened, with his
handsome head in Morvyth’s lap, and waited for her
less ill-starred lovers to return.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What gifts, I wonder, will they be bringing me,”
Queen Morvyth said, “at about this time to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Gonfal, without moving, sighed stupendously,
and answered: “To me, madame, they will be bringing
bitter gifts. For, whosoever wins in this quest, I lose:
and whatsoever he may bring to you, to me he brings
disseverance from content, and to me he brings a poignant
if brief period of loneliness before you decide to
have my head off.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now she caressed that head maternally. “Why, but
what a notion!” said Morvyth, now that the man himself
spoke of the nearing social duty whose imminence
had for some while been fretting her. “As if, sweetheart,
I would ever think of such a thing!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Undoubtedly, that will happen, madame. Marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>entails many obligations, not all of them pleasant.
Queens in particular have to preserve appearances, they
have to ensure the discretion of those whom they have
trusted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That,” she said, sorrowfully, “is what the dear old
Imaun has been telling me,—lately, you know. And
Masu talks about what a married woman owes to religion
and setting a fine moral example.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Gonfal, still smiling up at her, went on: “And
yet it seems an odd thing, delight of my delights, that
I shall leave you—for the headsman,—without any real
regret. For I am content. While my shrewd fellows
rode about the world to seek and to attain to power and
wisdom, I have elected, as an unpractical realist, to follow
after beauty. I have followed, to be sure, in the
phrase of that absurd young Grimauc, at a paid price,
yet, at that price, I have won, maimed and foredoomed,
to beauty. And I am content.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Queen put on the proper air of diffidence. “But
what, my friend, what, after all, is mere beauty?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he replied with the neatness which she always
rather distrusted. “Beauty, madame, is Morvyth. It
is not easy to describe either of these most dear and
blinding synonyms, as how many reams of ruined paper
attest!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She waited, still stroking him: and in her mind was
the old question, whether it was possible that, even now,
this man was laughing at her?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>She said: “But would it not grieve you unendurably,
sweetheart, to see me the wife of another man? And
so, would it not be really a kindness—?”</p>

<p class='c005'>But the obtuse fellow did not chivalrously aid in
smoothing her way to that nearing social duty. Instead,
he replied, oddly enough:</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Morvyth that I see, and in my manner worship,
can be no man’s wife. All poets learn this truth in
their vexed progress to becoming realists.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For yet another while the young Queen was silent.
And then she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not quite understand you, my dear, and probably
I never shall. But I know that through your love
of me you have twice maimed yourself, and have, as
though it were a trifle, put aside your chance of winning
honor and great wealth and all that gentle persons
most prize—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am,” he replied, “a realist. To get three utterly
pleasant years one pays, of course. But realists pay
without grumbling.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dearest,” the Queen continued,—now breathing
quicklier, and with the sort of very happy sobbing
which she felt the occasion demanded,—“you alone of
all the men who have talked and postured so much,
you alone have given me whole-hearted and undivided
love, not weighing even your own knightly honor and
worldly fame against the utterness of that love. And
while of course, just as the Imaun says, if I were ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>to marry anybody else, as I suppose I did promise to
do,—in a way, that is,—still, it is not as if I cared one
snap of my fingers about appearances, and I simply will
not have it cut off! For such utterly unselfish love as
yours, dear Gonfal, is the gift which is worthiest to
be my bridal gift: and, no matter what anybody says,
it is you who shall be my husband!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, but the cried quest, madame!” he answered,
“and your promise to those seven other idiots!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall proclaim to those detestable third sons, and
to the Imaun, and to Masu, and to everybody,” the
Queen said, “a very weighty and indeed a sacred truth.
I shall tell them that there is no gift more great than
love.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But the tall man who now stood before her shared in
nothing in the exaltedness of her sentiments; and his
dismay was apparent. “Alas, madame, you propose an
enormity! for we are all so utterly the slaves of our
catchwords that everybody would agree with you.
There is no hope in ‘what anybody may say.’ Imbeciles
everywhere will be saying that you have chosen
wisely.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Morvyth now sat peculiarly erect upon the ivory
couch. “I am sure, I am really quite sure, Gonfal,
that I do not understand you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean, madame, that—while of course your offer
is all that is most kind and generous,—that I must, here
again, in mere honesty, I must distinguish. I mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>that I think you know, as well as I do, love is not a
gift which any man can give nor any person hope long
to retain. Ah, no, madame! we shrug, we smilingly
allow romanticists their catchwords: meanwhile it remains
the veriest axiom, among realists like you and
me, that love too is but a loan.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So you have come back,” the Queen remarked, with
an approach to crossness, “to your eternal loans!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He slightly flung out both hands, palms upward.
“Love is that loan, my dear, which we accept most
thankfully. But at the same time let us concede, as
rational persons, the impermanence of all those materials
which customarily provoke the erotic emotions.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gonfal,” the young Queen said, “now you talk
stupidly. You talk with a dangerous lack of something
more important than discretion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My love, I talk, again, as a widower.” Then for a
while he said nothing: and it appeared to Morvyth that
this incomprehensible ingrate had shivered. He said:
“And still, still, I talk of mathematical certainties! For
how can you hope to remain in anything a lovable object?
In a score of years, or within at most two-score,
you will have become either fat or wrinkled, your teeth
will rot and tumble out, your eyes will blear; your
thighs will be most unenticingly mottled, your breath
will be unpleasant, and your breasts will have become
flabby bags. All these impairments, I repeat, my dear,
are mathematical certainties.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>To such horrid and irrelevant nonsense the Queen
replied, with dignity, “I am not your dear; and I simply
wonder at your impudence in ever for one moment
thinking I was.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, too,” the ill-mannered wretch had gone on,
meditatively, “you have not much intelligence. That
is very well for the present, because intelligence in
youth, for some reason or another, is bad for the hair
and muddies the complexion. Yet an aging woman
who is stupid, such as Madame Niafer or such as another
woman whom I remember, is also quite unendurable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what,” she asked him, rationally, “have I to do
with stupid old women? I am Morvyth, I am Queen
of the Isles of Wonder. I have the secrets which control
all wealth and—if I should ever take a fancy to
such things,—all wisdom too. There is no beauty like
my beauty, nor any power like my power—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know, I know!” he returned,—“and for the present
I of course adore you. But nevertheless, did I fall
in with your very dreadful suggestion, and permit you
to place me, quite publicly, at your dear side, upon the
terraced throne of Inis Dahut,—why, then, within a
terribly brief while, I would not mind your being stupid,
I would not actually notice your dilapidated looks,
I would accept all your shortcomings complacently.
And I would be contented enough with you, who, once,
were the despair and joy of my living. No, Morvyth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>no, my child! I, who was once a poet of sorts, could
not again endure to live in contentment with a stupid
and querulous woman who was unattractive to look at.
And, very certainly, within two-score of years—”</p>

<p class='c005'>But a queenly gesture had put a check to such wild
talk, and Morvyth too had arisen, saying:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your arithmetic becomes tiresome. One can afford
to honor truisms in their proper place, and about
suitable persons: but there is, and always must be, a
limit to the scope of such trite philosophy. Your audience
is over, Messire Gonfal. And it is your last audience,
because I consider you quite unutterably a beast.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He kissed the imperious little hand which dismissed
him. “You at all events, my dear,” he stated, “are
quite unutterably human.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THIS it came about, to the Imaun’s vast relief,—and,
as it seemed to the pious kindly old man,
perhaps in direct answer to his prayers that this
matter might be settled agreeably all around and without
any unpleasantness,—that the next day at noon,
just as the seven champions were returning with their
gifts, an attendant brought to Queen Morvyth the severed
head of Gonfal.</p>

<p class='c005'>This was in the vaulted hall of Tothmes, whose
building was a famous tale, and of whose splendors
travelers, come homeward, spoke without real hope to
be believed. There Morvyth waited, crowned, upon the
terraced throne: and without, on that bright April
morning, the trumpets sounded through the narrow
streets and over the bronze and lacquer roofs, proclaiming
that the mightiest and most shrewd of champions
were riding toward Inis Dahut from all kingdoms of
the earth, through their desire of the young Queen of
the Isles of Wonder whose beauty was the marvel of
the world, and a legend in far lands not known to her
even by their names.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Thus Morvyth sat: and at her feet one placed the
severed head of Gonfal. There was blood on the fair
beard: but still the lips were smiling, pallidly, over
something of no great importance. And in her mind
was the old question, whether it was possible that—even
now,—this man was laughing at her? Or, was it
possible, she wondered (as she of a sudden recollected
that first talk of theirs), that blondes did sometimes
last very damnably? and that some little washed-out
fly-by-night princess of nowhere in particular might
thus get, in one way or another, even from her grave,
the better of a great queen?</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, but there was no need for a great queen to
think as yet about graves, and their most unpleasant
contents. For Morvyth sat high, as yet, superb and
young and all powerful, in this fine palace of hers,
about which so many lovers sighed, and the bland winds
of April went caressingly.... Nobody denied that
this very tiresome wind would every year be coming
up from the South,—the lovely girl reflected, as she
fell meditatively to prodding with her toe at what remained
of Gonfal,—nor that, just so, this most persistent
wind would be coursing over Inis Dahut, when
there was no Morvyth and no palace in this place any
longer.... Nobody denied, and nobody except insane
and very rude persons thought at all seriously about,
such truisms.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was enough, for really pious people, that in youth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>one had the loan of a bright sheltering against the
ruthless and persistent wind which bore everything
away as dust: if one felt a bit low-spirited now and
then, it was not for any especial cause: and Morvyth—that,
as yet, for her permitted season, was Queen of
the five Isles of Wonder,—could hear the trumpets and
the heralds proclaiming the entry of Prince Chedric of
Lorn....</p>

<p class='c005'>He, then, was the first to return of those perfectly
detestable little meddlers who out of love for her had,
now for a third time, ransacked the riches of the world:
and he had rather nice eyes. Morvyth tidied her hair.</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the tale is no more of Gonfal, who was
the first to perish of the lords of the Silver Stallion.
The tale instead tells that, in the while of
Gonfal’s adventuring in Inis Dahut, yet three other
champions of the fellowship had left the Poictesme
which under Dame Niafer’s rule was altering day by
day. Coth of the Rocks, indeed, had ridden westward
within the same month that Gonfal departed for the
South. There was never any profitable arguing with
Coth: and so, when he declared his intention of fetching
back Dom Manuel into the Poictesme which women
and holy persons and lying poets—as Coth asserted,—were
making quite uninhabitable, nobody did argue.
Coth blustered westward, unmolested and unreasoned
with: and for that while no more was heard of him.</p>

<p class='c005'>And it was in the May of this year that Kerin of
Nointel, the Syndic and Castellan of Basardra, disappeared
even more unaccountably than Dom Manuel
had done, for about Kerin’s passing there were not
even any rumors. Kerin, so far as anybody could
learn, had vanished in the darkness of the night season
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>just as unaidedly as that darkness itself had vanished in
turn, and with just as slight vestigial traces of his passing.
The desolation of Kerin’s young wife, Dame
Saraïde, was such that dozens upon dozens of lovers
might not content her for her widowhood, as was immediately
shown: and of Kerin also, for that while, no
more was heard.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Miramon Lluagor, too, that under Manuel had
been the Lord Seneschal of Gontaron, had now gone
out of Poictesme,—sedately and unmysteriously departing,
with his wife and child seated beside him upon the
back of an elderly and quite tame dragon, for his former
home in the North. It was there that Miramon
had first encountered Dom Manuel in the days when
Manuel was only a swineherd. And it was there that
Miramon Lluagor hoped to pass the remainder of as
long a life as his doom permitted him, in such limited
comfort as might anywhere be possible for a married
man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Otherwise, he could foresee, upon the brighter side
of his appointed and appalling doom, nothing which
was likely to worry him. For Miramon Lluagor had
very wonderfully prospered at magic, he was, as they
say, now blessed with more than any reasonable person
would ask for: and the most clamant of these
superfluities appeared to him to be his wife.</p>

<p class='c005'>They tell how Miramon was one of the Léshy, born
of a people that was neither human nor immortal, telling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>how his ancestral home was builded upon the summit
of the mountain called Vraidex. To Vraidex
Miramon Lluagor returned, after the Fellowship of
the Silver Stallion had been disbanded, and Miramon
had ceased to amuse himself with the greatness of Manuel
and with the other notions of Poictesme.</p>

<p class='c005'>They narrate that this magician dabbled no more in
knight-errantry, for which the Seneschal of Gontaron—who
through his art was also lord of the nine kinds
of sleep and prince of the seven madnesses,—had never
shown any real forte. He righted no more wrongs, in
weather as often as not unsuited to a champion subject
to rheumatism, and he in no way taxed his comfort
to check the prospering of injustice. Instead, he
now maintained, upon the exalted scarps of Vraidex,
the sedate seclusion appropriate to a veteran sorcerer,
in his ivory tower carved out of one of the tusks of
Behemoth; and maintained also a handsome retinue
of every sort of horrific illusion to guard the approaches
to his Doubtful Palace; wherein, as the tale likewise
tells, this mage resumed his former vocation, and once
more designed the dreams for sleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus it was that, upon the back of the elderly and
quite tame dragon, Miramon returned to his earlier
pursuits and to the practice of what he—in his striking
way of putting things,—described as art for art’s sake.
The episode of Manuel had been, in the lower field of
merely utilitarian art, amusing enough. That stupid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>tall, quiet posturer, when he set out to redeem Poictesme,
had needed just the mere bit of elementary magic
which Miramon had performed for him, to establish
Manuel among the great ones of earth. Miramon had,
in consequence, sent a few obsolete gods to drive the
Northmen out of Poictesme, while Manuel waited upon
the sands north of Manneville and diverted his leisure
by contemplatively spitting into the sea. Thereafter
Manuel had held the land to the admiration of everybody
but more particularly of Miramon,—who did not
at all agree with Anavalt of Fomor in his estimation
of Dom Manuel’s mental gifts.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yes, it had been quite amusing to serve under Manuel,
to play at being lord of Gontaron and Ranec, and
to regard at close quarters this tall grave gray cockeyed
impostor, who had learned only not to talk....
For that, thought Miramon, was Manuel’s secret: Manuel
did not expostulate, he did not explain, he did not
argue; he, instead, in any time of trouble or of uncertainty,
kept quiet; and that quiet struck terror to his
ever-babbling race, and had earned for the dull-witted
but shrewd fellow—who was concealing only his lack
of any thought or of any plan,—a dreadful name for
impenetrable wisdom and for boundless resource.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Keep mum with Manuel!” said Miramon, “and all
things shall be added to you. It is a great pity that
my wife has not the knack for these little character
analyses.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Yes, the four years had been an amusing episode.
But dreams and the designing of dreams were the really
serious matters to which Miramon returned after this
holiday outing in carnage and statecraft.</p>

<p class='c005'>And here, too,—as everywhere,—his wife confronted
him. Miramon’s personal taste in art was for the
richly romantic sweetened with nonsense and spiced
with the tabooed. But his wife Gisèle had quite other
notions, a whole set of notions, and her philosophy was
that of belligerent individualism. And the sorcerer to
keep peace, at least in the intervals between his wife’s
more mordantly loquacious moments, must of necessity
design such dreams as Gisèle preferred. But he
knew that these dreams did not express the small
thoughts and fancies which harbored in the heart of
Miramon Lluagor, and which would perish with the
falling of his doom unless he wrought these fancies
into dreams that, being fleshless, might evade carnivorous
time.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was preëminent among the dream-makers of this
world, he was the dreaded lord (because of his retinue
of illusions) over all the country about Vraidex: but,
in his own home he was not dreaded, he, very certainly,
was not preëminent. And Miramon hungered for the
lost freedom of his bachelorhood.</p>

<p class='c005'>His wife also was discontent, because the ways of
the Léshy appeared to this mortal woman indecorous.
The dooms that were upon the Léshy seemed not entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>in good taste, to her who had been born of a
race about whom destiny appeared not to bother. In
fact, it was a continual irritation to Gisèle that her
little boy Demetrios was predestinate to kill his father
with the charmed sword Flamberge. This was a
doom Gisèle found not the sort of thing you cared to
have imminent in your own family: and she felt that
the sooner the gray Norns, who weave the fate of all
that live, were spoken to quite candidly, the better it
would be for everybody concerned.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was irritated by the mere sight of Flamberge.
So her thinking was not of silk and honey when, after
polishing the sword as was her usage upon Thursday
morning, she came into Miramon’s ivory tower to hang
the fatal weapon in its right place.</p>

<p class='c005'>With Miramon under the green tasseled canopy sat
one whom Gisèle was not unsurprised to see there. For
closeted with Miramon to-day was Ninzian, the High
Bailiff of Yair and Upper Ardra, who was the most
famous for his piety of all the lords of the Silver
Stallion. The dreadful need and the peculiar reason
which Ninzian had for being pious and philanthropic
were matters not known to everybody: but Miramon
Lluagor knew about these things, and therefore he
made appropriate use of Ninzian. Indeed, upon this
very afternoon, the two were looking at that which
Ninzian had fetched out of the land of Assyria, and
had procured for the sorcerer, at a price.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW Madame Gisèle also was looking at that
which Ninzian had procured for her husband
at a price. She looked at it—upon the whole—with
slightly less disfavor than she afterward looked
at the two men.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A good day and a grand blessing to you, Messire
Ninzian!” said Madame Gisèle: and she extended her
hand, along with her scouring-rag, for him to kiss,
and she inquired about his wife Dame Balthis, pleasantly
enough. She spoke then, in a different tone, to
Miramon Lluagor. “And with what are you cluttering
up the house now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, wife,” replied Miramon, “here, very secretly
fetched out of the land of Assyria, are those bees about
whom it is prophesied that they shall rest upon all
bushes. Here are the bright bees of Toupan, a treasure
beyond word or thinking. They are not as other
bees, for theirs is the appearance of shining ice: and
they crawl fretfully, as they have crawled since Toupan’s
downfall, about this cross of black stone—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is a very likely story for you to be telling me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>who can see that the disgusting creatures have wings to
fly away with whenever they want to! And, besides,
who in the world is this Toupan?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is nobody in this world, wife, and it is wiser
not to speak of him. Let it suffice that in the time of
the Old Ones he made all things as they were. Then
Koshchei came out of Ydalir, and took the power from
Toupan, and made all things as they are. Yet three of
Toupan’s servitors endure upon earth, where they who
were once lords of the Vendish have now no privilege
remaining save to creep humbly as insects: the use of
their wings is denied them here among the things which
were made by Koshchei, and the charmed stone holds
them immutably. Oho, but, wife, there is a cantrap
which would free them, a cantrap which nobody has as
yet discovered, and to their releaser will be granted
whatever his will may desire—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is some more of your stuff and nonsense, out
of old fairy tales, where everybody gets three wishes,
and no good from any of them!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, my love, because I shall put them to quite practical
uses. For you must know that when I have found
out the cantrap which will release the bees of Toupan—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Gisèle showed plainly that his foolishness did not
concern her. She sighed, and she hung the sword in
its accustomed place. “Oh, but I am aweary of this
endless sorcery and piddling with vain dreams!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Then, wife,” said Miramon, “then why are you
perpetually meddling with what you do not understand?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think,” Ninzian observed at once, for Ninzian too
was married, “I think that I had best be going.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Gisèle’s attention was reserved for her husband.
“I meddle, as you so very politely call it, because you
have no sense of what is right and proper, and no sense
of morals, and no sense of expediency, and, in fact, no
sense at all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miramon said, “Now, dearest—!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian was hastily picking up his hat.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Gisèle continued, with that resistless and devastating
onflow which is peculiar to tidal waves and the
tongue of her who speaks for her husband’s own good.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Women everywhere,” Gisèle generalized, “have a
hard time of it: but in particular do I pity the woman
that is married to one of you moonstruck artists. She
has not half a husband, she has but the tending of
a baby with long legs—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is so much later than I thought, that really
now—” observed Ninzian, ineffectively.</p>

<p class='c005'>“—And I might have had a dozen husbands—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miramon said, “But, surely, no woman of your well-known
morality, my darling—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“—I might, as you very well remember, have married
Count Manuel himself—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know. I can recall how near you came to marrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>him. He was a dull, a cold-blooded and a rather
dishonest clod-hopper: but the luck of Manuel Pig-Tender
did not ever desert him,” said Miramon, sighing,
“not even then!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I say, I might have had my pick of a dozen really
prominent and looked-up-to warriors, who would have
had the decency to remember our anniversary and my
birthday, and in any event would never have been in
the house twenty-four hours a day! Instead, here I
am tied to a muddle-head who fritters away his time
contriving dreams that nobody cares about one way or
the other! And yet, even so—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And yet, even so—as you were no doubt going on
to observe, my dearest,—even so, since your soliloquy
pertains to matters in which our guest could not conceivably
be interested—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And yet,” said Gisèle, with a heavier and a deadlier
emphasis, “even so, if only you would be sensible
about your silly business I could put up with the inconvenience
of having you underfoot every moment.
People need dreams to help them through the night, and
nobody enjoys a really good dream more than I do
when I have time for it, with the million and one things
that are put upon me. But dreams ought to be wholesome—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My darling, now, as a matter of esthetics, as a mere
point of fact—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“—But dreams ought to be wholesome, they ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>to be worth while, they ought to teach an uplifting
moral, and certainly they ought not to be about incomprehensible
thin nonsense that nobody can half way
understand. They ought, in a word, to make you feel
that the world is a pretty good sort of place, after
all—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, wife, I am not sure that it is,” said Miramon,
mildly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, the more shame to you! and the very least
you can do is to keep such morbid notions to yourself,
and not be upsetting other people’s repose with them!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I employ my natural gift, I express myself and
none other. The rose-bush does not put forth wheat,
nor flax either,” returned the sorcerer, with a tired
shrug. “In fine, what would you have?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A great deal it means to you,—you rose-bush!—what
I prefer! But if I had my wish your silly dream-making
would be taken away from you so that we
might live in some sort of reputable and common-sense
way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>All the while that she reasoned sensibly and calmly
with her husband for his own good, Gisèle had feverishly
been dusting things everywhere, just to show
what a slave she was to him, and because it irritated
Miramon to have his personal possessions thus dabbed
at and poked about: and now, as she spoke, Gisèle
slapped viciously with her scouring-rag at the black
cross. And a thing happened to behold which would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>have astonished the innumerous mages and the enchanters
who had given over centuries to searching for
the cantrap which would release the bees of Toupan.
For now without any exercise of magic the scouring-rag
swept from the stone one of the insects. Koshchei,
who made all things as they are, had decreed, they
report, that these bright perils could be freed only in
the most obvious way, because he knew this would be
the last method attempted by any learned person.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then for an instant the walls of the ivory tower were
aquiver like blown veils. And the bee passed glitteringly
to the window and through the clear glass of the
closed window, leaving a small round hole there, as
the creature went to join its seven fellows in the
Pleiades.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW, when this eighth bright bee had joined its
seven fellows in the Pleiades, then Toupan,
afloat in the void, unclosed his ancient unappeasable
eyes. Jacy returned to his aforetime estate
in the moon: all plants and trees everywhere were withered,
and the sea also lost its greenness, and there were
no more emeralds. And the Star Warriors and the
Wardens of the Worlds were troubled, and They cried
out to Koshchei who had devised Them and who had
placed Them in Their stations to remain in eternal
watchfulness over all things as they are.</p>

<p class='c005'>Koshchei, for reasons of his own, did not reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Jacy whispered to Toupan: “Now is the hour
of thy release, O Toupan! now is the hour that Koshchei
falls. For among the things that are there stays
no verdancy anywhere, and without green things nobody
can keep health and strength.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Toupan answered: “I am diminished. My bones
have become like silver, and my members have turned
into gold, and my hair is like lapis-lazuli.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thine eyes remain unchanged,” said the slow whispering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>of Jacy. “Send forth thine eyes, O Toupan,
against the work of Koshchei, who has blasphemed
against the Old Ones, and who has created things as
they are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Though he acknowledge both of these misdoings,
why need my eyes be troubled—as yet?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Jacy said, “Send forth thine eyes, O Toupan,
so that we Old Ones may rejoice in the dreadfulness
of thy overlooking!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Toupan answered: “I was before the Old Ones. My
soul was before thought and time. It is the soul of
Shu, it is the soul of Khnemu, it is the soul of Heh:
it is the soul of Night and of Desolation, and there is
a thinking about my soul which looks out of the eyes
of every serpent. My soul alone keeps any knowledge
of that dark malignity which everywhere encompasses
the handiwork of Koshchei who made things as they
are. Why need my soul be troubled, therefore,—as
yet?”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Jacy said again: “Give aid now to the Old Ones!
Already thy bees go forth, that shall rest upon all
bushes, and already no verdancy remains. Send forth
thine eyes now, also, in which there is the knowledge
denied to Koshchei!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Toupan answered: “The time of my release is
not yet at hand. Nevertheless, between now and a
while, when yet another bee is loosed, I shall bestir my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>soul, I will send forth my eyes, so that all may perceive
the dreadfulness of my overlooking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At that the Star Warriors and the Wardens of the
Worlds cried out again to Koshchei.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Koshchei answered Them: “Have patience!
When Toupan is released I perish with You. Meanwhile
I have made all things as they are.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW also, when this eighth bright bee had joined
its fellows in the Pleiades, in that same instant
Miramon Lluagor, as he stood appalled in his
ivory tower, was aware of a touch upon his forehead,
as if a damp sponge were passing over it. Then he
perceived that, with the petulant voicing of his damnable
wife’s desire, he had forthwith forgotten the secret
of his preëminence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Something he could yet recall, they say, of the magic
of the Purin and the cast stones, of the Horse and the
Bull of the Water, and most of the lore of the Apsarasas
and the Faidhin remained to him. He could still
make shift, he knew, to control the roving Lamboyo,
to build the fearful bridge of the White Ladies, or to
contrive the dance of the Korred. He retained his
communion with Necksa and Paralda, those sovereign
Elementaries. He kept his mastery of the Shedeem
who devastate, of the Shehireem who terrify, and of
the Mazikeen who destroy. Nor had he lost touch
with the Stewards of Heaven,—of whom at this period
Och had the highest power and was customarily summoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>by Miramon Lluagor, for a brief professional
consultation, every Sunday morning at sunrise.</p>

<p class='c005'>But such accomplishments, as Miramon despairingly
knew, were the stock in trade of mere hedge wizards,
they were the rudiments of any fairly competent sorcerer
anywhere: and that supreme secret which had
made Miramon Lluagor the master of all dreams was
gone away from him completely.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was very angry. He was the angrier for that he
saw, just for an instant, a sort of frightened and bewildered
remorse in his wife’s foolish face, and he desperately
foreknew himself to be upon the brink of comforting
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Accursed woman!” Miramon cried out, “now indeed
has your common-sense completed what your nagging
began! This is the doom of all artists that have
to do with well-conducted women. Truly has it been
said that the marriage-bed is the grave of art. Well, I
have put up with much from you, but this settles it, and
I will not put up with your infatuation for a reputable
and common-sense way of living, and I wish you were
in the middle of next week!”</p>

<p class='c005'>With that he caught the soiled scouring-rag from the
hand of Gisèle, and he slapped at one of the remaining
bees, and he brushed it from the black cross. And this
bee departed as the other had done.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>WHEN this bright bee had departed as the
other had done before him, then Toupan
moved his wings, and he made ready to
overlook the work of Koshchei: and in the instant
that Toupan moved, the worlds in that part of the universe
were dislodged and ran melting down the sky.
It was Gauracy who swept all the fragments together
and formed a sun immeasurably larger than that which
he had lost, and an obstreperous mad conflagration
which did not in anything conform with the handiwork
of Koshchei.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Gauracy then shouted friendlily to Toupan,
“Now is the hour of thy release, O Toupan! now is
the hour of the return of the Old Ones, now is the
hour that Koshchei falls!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Toupan answered: “The hour of my release is not
yet come. But this is the hour of my overlooking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Gauracy bellowed, as he swept yet other worlds
into the insatiable flaming of his dreadful sun, “I kindle
for you a fine light to see by!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And now the gods who were worshiped in those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>worlds which remained, these also cried out to Koshchei.
For now, in the intolerable glare of Gauracy’s
malefic sun, they showed as flimsy and incredible inventions.
And the gods knew, moreover, that, if ever
the last remaining bee were freed from the cross, the
dizain of the Pleiades would be completed, and Toupan
would be released, and the power of the Old Ones
would return; and that a day foretold by many prophets,
the day upon which every god must shave with a
razor that is hired, would be at hand; and that, with
the falling about of this very dreadful and ignominious
necessity, the day of the divine contentment of all gods
in any place would be over, forever.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile the eyes of Toupan went forth, among
the Star Warriors and the Wardens of the Worlds.
It was They who, under Koshchei, had shaped the
earths and the waters, and who had knit together the
mountains, and who had fashioned all other things as
they are. It was They who had woven the heavens,
and who had placed the soul of every god within him.
They were the makers of the hours and the creators
of the days and the kindlers of the fires of life, and
They were powers whose secret and sustaining names
were not known to any of the gods of men. Yet now
the eyes of Toupan went among the Star Warriors
and the Wardens of the Worlds, and Toupan regarded
them one by one; and wheresoever the old eyes of Toupan
had rested there remained no world nor any Warden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>watching over it, but only, for that instant, a very
little spiral of thin sluggish vapor.</p>

<p class='c005'>And those of Them who were not yet destroyed cried
piteously to Koshchei, who had devised Them and who
had placed Them in Their stations to keep eternal
watchfulness over all things as they are.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now there is no denying that, in the manner of
artists, Koshchei had cleared his throat, and had fidgeted
a little, in the while that Toupan was overlooking
Koshchei’s handiwork. But when the Wardens and
the Star Warriors cried out to him for aid, then Koshchei,
lifting never a finger, said only:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Eh, sirs, have patience! For I made all things as
they are; and I know now it is my safeguard that I
made them in two ways.”</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>BUT Miramon, in his ivory tower upon Vraidex,
knew only that his wish had been granted, for
Gisèle had gone just as a bubble breaks, and she
was now somewhere in the middle of next week.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And a good riddance, too!” said Miramon. He
turned to Ninzian, that smiling large philanthropist.
“For did you ever see the like of such outrageousness
as her outrageousness!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, very often,” replied this Ninzian, who too was
married. Then Ninzian asked, “But what will you do
next?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Said Miramon, “I shall wish to have back the secret
and the solace of my art.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But to Ninzian this seemed less obvious. “You can
do that, readily enough, by releasing the third bee which
my devices have procured for you out of the land of
Assyria. Yes, Miramon, you can in this manner get
back your art, but thus also you will be left defenseless
against the doom which is appointed. So, friend, by
my advice you will, instead, employ the cantrap as you
at first intended, and you will secure for yourself eternal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>life by wishing that Flamberge may vanish from this
world of men.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Ninzian waved toward the sword with which
according to the foreordainment of the Norns great
Miramon Lluagor was to be killed by his own son.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fallen sorcerer answered, “Of what worth is
life if it breed no more dreams?” And Miramon said
also, “I wonder, Ninzian, just where is the middle of
next week?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Sleek Ninzian spoke, secure in his peculiar erudition.
“It will fall upon a Wednesday, but nobody knows
whence. Olybrius states it is now in Aratu, where all
that enter are clothed like a bird with wings, and have
only dust and clay to eat in the unchanging twilight—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She would not like that. She had always a delicate
digestion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whereas Asinius Pollio suggests, not unplausibly,
that it waits beyond Slid and Gjold, in the blue house
of Nostrand, where Sereda bleaches the unborn
Wednesdays, under a roof of plaited serpents—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear me!” said Miramon, disconsolately rubbing at
his nose, “now that would never suit a woman with an
almost morbid aversion to reptiles!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“—But Sosicles declares it is in Xibalba, where Zipacna
and Cabrakan play at handball, and the earthquakes
are at nurse.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She would be none the happier there. She does
not care for babies, she would not for one moment put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>up with a fractious young earthquake, and she would
make things most uncomfortable for everybody. Ninzian,”—and
Miramon cleared his throat,—“Ninzian, I
begin to fear I have been a little hasty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is the frailty of all you artists,” the man of affairs
replied. “So my advice, about Flamberge, is not
to the purpose?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, but, you see,” said Miramon, very miserably,
“or perhaps I ought to say that, while of course, still,
when you come to look at it more carefully, Ninzian,
what I really mean is that the fact is, as it seems to
me—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The fact is,” Ninzian returned, with a depressed
but comprehending smile, “you are a married man. So
am I. Well, then, you have one wish remaining, and
no more. You can at will desire to have back again
the control of your lost magics or you can have back
your wife to control you—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” Miramon agreed, forlornly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And indeed,” sleek Ninzian went on, with that glib
optimism reserved for the dilemmas of one’s friends,
“indeed it is in many ways a splendid thing for you
to have the choice clear cut. Nobody can succeed alike
at being an artist and a husband. I hold no brief for
either career, because I think that art is an unreasonable
mistress, and I think also that a wife is amenable to
the same description. But I am certain no man can
serve both.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Miramon sighed. “That is true. There is no marriage
for the maker of dreams, because he is perpetually
creating finer women than earth provides. The touch
of flesh cannot content him who has arranged the shining
hair of angels and modeled the breasts of the
sphinx. The woman that shares his bed is there of
course, much as the blanket or the pillow is there, and
each is an aid to comfort. But what has the maker of
dreams, what has that troubled being who lives inside
the creature which a mirror reveals to him, to do with
women? At best, these animals provide him with models
to be idealized beyond the insignificant truth, somewhat
as I have made a superb delirium with only a
lizard to start on. And at worst, these animals can live
through no half-hour without meddling where they do
not understand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Miramon kept silence. He was fingering the
magic colors with which he blazoned the first sketches
of his dreams. Here was his white, which was the
foam of the ocean made solid, and the black he had
wrung from the burned bones of nine emperors. Here
was the yellow slime of Scyros, and crimson cinnabaris
composed of the mingled blood of mastodons and dragons,
and here was the poisonous blue sand of Puteoli.
And Miramon, who was no longer a potent sorcerer,
considered that loveliness and horror which a moment
ago he had known how to evoke with these pigments,
he who had now no power to lend life to his designs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and who kept just skill enough it might be to place the
stripings on a barber’s pole.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Miramon Lluagor said: “It would be a sad happening
if I were never again to sway the sleeping of
men, and grant them yet more dreams of distinction
and clarity, of beauty and symmetry, of tenderness and
truth and urbanity. For whether they like it or not,
I know what is good for them, and it affords to their
starved living that which they lack and ought to have.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Miramon said also: “Yet it would be another
sad happening were my poor wife permitted eternally
to scold the shivering earthquakes in the middle of
next week. What does it matter that I do not especially
like her? There is a great deal about myself
that I do not like, such as my body’s flabbiness and
the snub nose which makes ludicrous the face I wear:
but do I hanker to be transformed into a sturdy man-at-arms?
do I view the snout of an elephant with covetousness?
Why, but, Ninzian, I am astonished at
your foolish talking! What need have I of perfection?
what would I have in common with anybody who was
patient with me and thought highly of my doings?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miramon shook his head, with some sternness. “No,
Ninzian, it is in vain that you pester me with your
continuous talking, for I am as used to her shortcomings
as I am to my own shortcomings. I regard her
tantrums with the resignation I extend to inclement
weather. It is unpleasant. All tempests are unpleasant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Ah, yes, but if life should become an endless clear
May afternoon we could not endure it, we who have
once been lashed by storms would cross land and sea
to look for snow and pelting hail. Just so, to have
Gisèle about keeps me perpetually fretted; but now that
she is gone I am miserable. No, Ninzian, you may
spare your talking, you need say no more, for I simply
could not put up with being left to live in comfort.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian had heard him through without impatience,
because they were both married men. Now Ninzian,
shrugging, said, “Then do you choose, Miramon, for
your wife and no more dreams, or for your art and
loneliness?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such wishing would be over-wasteful,” Miramon
replied, as he dusted away the third bee. “Since I can
bear to give up neither my wife nor my art, no matter
how destroyingly they work against each other, I wish
for everything to be put back just where it was an hour
ago.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The third bee flew in a wide circle, and returned to
the cross. The knowledge which Miramon had lost was
put back into his mind.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>EVEN as the knowledge which Miramon had lost
was put back into his mind, just so did life reawaken
in all else which had perished in that
hour. Gauracy’s baleful sun was gone, and the dislodged
and incinerated worlds, with all their satellites,
were revolving trimly in their proper places, undamaged.
And the gods who were worshiped in these
worlds now made a celestial rejoicing, because once
more there were only seven Pleiades. The Old Ones
had sunk back into their sleeping; things, for the while,
stayed as they are; and even Toupan now seemed harmless
enough....</p>

<p class='c005'>For the eyes were closed wherein lurked tireless and
unappeasable malignity, and a remembrance of all that
which was before Koshchei’s time, and an undivulged
foreknowledge which withered Toupan shared with
brisk little Koshchei alone. Nobody could speak certainly
about this: yet it was whispered that both of
these well knew that, in the end, the Old Ones would
return, and that only Toupan knew in what manner
and at what hour....</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>But above the gods who in the multitudinous heavens
and paradises were now rejoicing over their regained
omnipotence, far higher than these junketing
gods stood the Star Warriors and the Wardens of the
Worlds, each in the appointed place, and each once
more set in eternal watchfulness over all things as they
are. And the Star Warriors and the Wardens of the
Worlds said, soberly, to Koshchei:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir, your protection is established. You are protected
as the guide of the things which exist and of
the things which are not yet created. You are protected
as a dweller in the realm which goes round about
Those who are over Hidden Things. For now the
Old Ones sleep again, and not any new thing anywhere
shall ever gain the mastery over you, who are our only
master: and all things as they are stay yours forever.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Koshchei replied, rather absent-mindedly: “What
need was there to worry? Did I not make my creatures
male and female? and did I not make the tie which is
between them, that cord which I wove equally of love
and of disliking? Eh, sirs, but that is a strong cord,
and though all things that are depend upon it, my
weaving holds.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They answered him, “Your weaving holds, sir, assuredly:
yet you do not rejoice, as we rejoice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, but,” said Koshchei, “but I do so hate flat
incivility! And after overlooking my handiwork, the
fellow might very well have said something intelligent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Nobody minds an honest criticism. Just to say nothing—and
in that rather marked way, you know,—is
stupid!”</p>

<p class='c005'>For Koshchei also, they relate, was, in his fashion,
an artist.</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>BUT that lesser artist, Miramon Lluagor—once
more a potent sorcerer, in his ivory tower, and
once more preëminent among the dream-makers
of this world,—knew nothing of how he had played
havoc with the handiwork of Koshchei who made things
as they are. Miramon only knew that upon the black
stone cross were buzzing fretfully three bees, who had
now no luster and no power to grant wishes to anybody;
and that his wife Gisèle also was making noises,
not fretfully but in a tearing rage.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A pretty trick that was to play on me!” she said.
“Oh, but I pity the woman that is married to an artist!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But why do you perpetually meddle without understanding?”
he replied, as fretful as the accursed bees,
as angry as the intolerable woman....</p>

<p class='c005'>And they went on very much as before....</p>

<p class='c005'>They went on very much as before, because, as
Miramon put it, the Norns, for all their strength, had
not been able to contrive for him any doom more inflexible
than he, like every other married man who
holds his station unmurderously, had contrived out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>his weakness. The way of Miramon Lluagor’s death,
said he, was set and inescapable, because he was one of
the Léshy: but the way of his life he blushed to find
quite equally set and inescapable, because he was also
a husband. In brief, he detested this woman; she pestered
his living, she hampered his art, and with her
foolish notions about his art she had, now, frittered
away his immortality: but he was rather fond of her,
too, and he was used to her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Miramon, in any event, fell back upon his famous
saying that the secret of a contented marriage is to
pay particular attention to the wives of everybody else;
and from this axiom he derived what comfort he could.
He might, he reflected, have been married to that sallow,
crippled, flat-faced Niafer, who in the South was
upsetting all the familiar customs of Poictesme with
her unrelenting piety, and who was actually imposing
upon her associates that sort of reputable and common-sense
way of living which Gisèle at worst only talked
about. Niafer, indeed, seemed to be becoming wholly
insane; for very curious tales reached Miramon as to
the nonsense which this woman, too, was talking, about—of
all mad fancies!—how that cockeyed husband of
hers was to return by and by, in another incarnation....
Or Miramon, instead of his lost comrade Kerin
of Nointel, might have been married to that chit of a
Saraïde who had managed so artfully to dispose of
her husband, in some undetected manner or another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and who was now providing poor Kerin with such a
host of extra-legal successors.... Yes, Miramon
would reflect (in Gisèle’s absence), he might—conceivably
at least,—have been worse off. Yet, a bit
later, with her return, this possibility would seem more
and more dubious.</p>

<p class='c005'>And—in fine,—they went on very much as before.
And Miramon Lluagor was preëminent among the
dream-makers of this world, and he was a dreaded
lord: but in his own home he was not dreaded, and
he, very certainly, was not preëminent.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, when the time was due, fell the appointed
doom of Miramon, and he was slain by his son Demetrios
with the charmed sword Flamberge. For this
thing, people say, had long ago been agreed upon by
the Norns, who weave the fate of all that live: to them
it could not matter that Miramon Lluagor was preeminent
among the dream-makers of this world, because
the Norns do not ever sleep: and no sorcerer,
through whatsoever havoc and upsetment of Koshchei’s
chosen economy, has, in the end, power to withstand
the Norns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Demetrios went far oversea into Anatolia;
and he married Callistion there, and in yet other ways
he won a fine name for his hardihood and shrewdness.
And in the years that followed, he prospered (for a
while) without any check, and, because of a joke about
Priapos, he pulled down one emperor of heathenry, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>raise up in his stead another emperor with superior
taste in humor. Demetrios held wide power and much
land, and was a ruthless master over all the country
between Quesiton and Nacumera. He was supreme
there, as upon Vraidex Miramon Lluagor had been
supreme. It was the boast of Demetrios that he feared
nobody in any of the worlds beneath or above him,
and that boast was truthful.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet none of these preëminencies could avail Demetrios,
when the time was due, and when the doom of
Demetrios fell in that manner and that instant which
the Norns had agreed upon, and when he who had put
his father out of life with the great sword was, in his
turn, put out of life with a small wire. For this thing
also, people say, had been appointed by Urdhr and Verdandi
and Skuld as they sat weaving under Yggdrasill
beside the carved door of the Sylan’s House: and to
this saying the didactic like to add that no warrior,
through whatsoever havoc and upsetment of human
economy, has, in the end, power to withstand the
Norns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now it was this Demetrios who married, among
many other women, Dom Manuel’s oldest daughter
Melicent, as is narrated in her saga.</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the tale is again of Coth, and of how Coth
went blustering westward to fetch back Dom
Manuel into his Poictesme, which, as Coth asserted,
skinny women and holy persons and lying poets
were making quite uninhabitable. It is probable that
Coth thus more or less obliquely referred to the Countess
Niafer herself, as well as to Holy Holmendis and
to pious Ninzian and to the most virtuous but not
plump Madame Balthis, the wife of Ninzian, since these
three nowadays were the advisers of Dame Niafer in
everything. It is certain that, even in these early days,
Dom Manuel had already become a legend; and the
poets everywhere were rehearsing his valor and his wisdom
and his noble excellencies in all the affairs of
this life.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Coth of the Rocks twirled his mustachios, and
he disapprovingly shook his great bald head, and he
went very quickly away from all these reformings of
Poictesme and of the master whom his heart remembered
and desired. Coth of the Rocks traveled westward,
without any companion, faring alone by land
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>and sea. Coth broke his journeying, first, at Sorcha,
and he companioned there with Credhê of the Red
Brown Hair: he went thence to the Island of Hunchback
Women, and it was in that island (really a peninsula)
he had so much pleasure, and deadly trouble too,
with a harlot named Bar, the wife of Ögir. But in
neither of these realms did Coth get any sure news of
Dom Manuel, although there was a rumor of such a
passing. Then, at Kushavati, in a twilit place of rustling
leaves and very softly chiming little bells, Coth
found, with the aid of Dame Abonde, the book of maps
by which he was thereafter to be guided.</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth journeyed, in fine, ever westward, with such
occasional stays to rest or copulate or fight as were the
natural concomitants of travel. In some lands he found
only ill-confirmed reports that such a person as Dom
Manuel had passed that way before him: in other lands
there was no report. But Coth had reason, after what
Abonde had showed him in that secluded place under
the rustling leaves, to put firm faith in his maps.</p>

<p class='c005'>So he went on, always westward, with varied and
pleasant enough adventures befalling him, at Leyma,
and Skeaf, and Adrisim. He had great sorrow at
Murnith, in the Land of Marked Bodies, on account
of a religious custom there prevalent and of the girl
Felfel Rhasif Yedua; and—at Ran Reigan,—the one-legged
Queen Zélélé held him imprisoned for a while,
in her harem of half a hundred fine men. Yet, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>main, Coth got on handily, in part by honoring the
religious customs everywhere, but chiefly by virtue of
his maps and his natural endowments. These last enabled
him amply to deal with all men who wanted a
quarrel and with all women whom he found it expedient
to placate and to surprise: and as far as to Lower
Yarold, and even to Khaikar the Red, his maps served
faithfully to guide him, until Coth perforce went over
the edge of the last one, into a country which was not
upon any map; and in this way approached, though
he did not know it, to the city of Porutsa.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus, it was near Porutsa that Coth found a stone
image standing in a lonely field which was overgrown
with pepper plants. Among these plants, charred thighbones
and ribs and other put-by appurtenances of mankind
lay scattered everywhither rather dispiritingly:
and before the image were the remnants of yet other
burnt offerings, upon a large altar carved everywhere
with skulls.</p>

<p class='c005'>This image represented a seated and somewhat
scantily clothed giant carved of black stone: from its
ears hung rings of gold and silver; its face was painted
with five horizontal yellow stripes; and a great gleaming
jewel, which might or might not be an emerald, was
set in its navel. Such was the limited apparel of this
giant’s person. But in the right hand of the image
were four arrows, and the left hand held a curious fan
made of a mirror surrounded by green and yellow and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>blue feathers. Coth had never before seen such an
idol as this.</p>

<p class='c005'>“However, in this unknown region,” Coth reflected,
“there are, doubtless, a large number of unknown gods.
They may not amount to much, but Dame Abonde has
taught me that in religious matters a traveler loses nothing
by civility.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth knelt. He tendered fealty, and he prayed to
this image for protection in his search for his lost liege-lord.
Coth heard a voice saying:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your homage is accepted. Your prayers are
granted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth looked upward, still kneeling. Coth saw that
the huge black image regarded him with living eyes,
and that the mouth of this image was now of moving
purple flesh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your prayers are granted, full measure,” the image
continued, “because you are the first person of your
pallid color and peculiar clothing to come over the edge
of the map and worship me. Such enterprise in piety
ought to be rewarded: and I shall reward it, prodigally.
Bald-headed man with long mustaches, I promise you,
upon the oath of the Star Warriors, even by the Word
of the Tzitzi-Mimé, that you shall rule over all the
country of Tollan. So that is settled: and now do
you tell me who you are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am Coth of the Rocks, the Alderman of St. Didol.
I followed Dom Manuel of Poictesme, about whom the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>poets nowadays are telling so many outrageous lies. I
followed him, that is, until he rode westward to a far
place beyond the sunset. Now I still follow him, since
to do that was my oath: and I have come into the West,
not to rule over this outlandish place, but to get news
of my master, and to fetch him back into Poictesme.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will get no such news from me, for I never
heard of this Manuel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, then, whatever sort of deity can you be!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am Yaotl, the Capricious Lord, the Enemy upon
Both Sides. This is my Place of the Dead: but I have
everywhere power in this land, and I shall have all
power in this land when once I have driven out the
Feathered Serpent.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then let me tell you, Messire Yaotl, you might very
profitably add to this power at least such knowledge as
is common to the run of civilized persons. It is not
becoming in any deity never to have heard of my liege-lord
Dom Manuel, who was the greatest of all captains,
and who founded the Fellowship of the Silver Stallion,
of which I had the honor to be a member. Such ignorance
appears strange in anybody. In a deity it is
perfectly preposterous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was only saying—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stop interrupting me! What sort of god are you,
who break in upon the devotional exercises of people
when they are actually upon their knees! It is my
custom, sir, whenever I go into a foreign country, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>be civil to the gods of that country; and I am thus
quite familiar with the behavior appropriate to a deity
in such circumstances. When people pray to you, you
ought to exhibit more repose of manner and a certain
well-bred reticence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, go away!” said the image of Yaotl, “and stop
lecturing me! Go up into Porutsa yonder, where the
Taoltecs live, and where it may be they have heard of
your Dom Manuel, since the Taoltecs also are fools
and worship the Feathered Serpent. And when you are
emperor over the country of Tollan, do you come back
and pray to me more civilly!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth rose up from his kneeling, in strong indignation.
“I tendered fealty in the liberal sense appropriate
to religious matters. It was but a bit of politeness
recommended by Dame Abonde, and I did not mean a
word of it—”</p>

<p class='c005'>The image replied: “Nobody cares what you meant,
it matters only what you have sworn. I have accepted
your sworn homage; and the affair is concluded.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“—And upon no terms,” Coth continued, “would I
consent to be emperor of this outlandish place. For
the rest, do you instantly tell me what you meant by
saying ‘the Taoltecs also are fools,’ because I do not
understand that ‘also.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” said the image, wearily, “but you will have
to be emperor, now that I have sworn it upon the oath
of the Star Warriors. I do not deny that I spoke hastily:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>even so, I did say it, with an unbreakable oath;
and, here likewise, the affair is concluded.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth replied, “Stuff and nonsense!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are now,” continued the image of Yaotl,
“under my protection: and as a seal of this, I must
put upon you three refrainments. We will make them
very light ones, since this is but a matter of form. I
will order you to refrain from such things as no sane
person would ever dream of doing in any event; and
thus nobody will be discommoded.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth cried out, “Bosh!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So you must not infringe upon divine privileges by
going naked in public; you must avoid any dealings
with green peppers such as you see over yonder, for
the reason that they are sacred to my worthless stepson,
the Flower Prince; and the third refrainment
which I now put upon you I shall not bother to reveal,
because you are certain to find this abstinence even
more easy to observe than the others. I have spoken.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know well enough that you have spoken! But
you have spoken balderdash. For if you for one moment
think I am going to be bullied by you and your
idiotic refrainments—!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Coth saw that the image had closed its eyes, and
had tranquilly turned back in all to stone, and was not
heeding him any longer.</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>COTH was goaded, by such incivility, from indignation
into a fine rage. He addressed the
idol at some length, in terms which no person,
whether human or divine, could have construed as worshipful.
He gathered from the plants about him an
armful of green peppers, he took off all his clothes,
and he left them there in a heap upon the altar that was
carved with skulls. He went up into the city of Porutsa
stark naked and sat down in the market-place,
crying, “Who will buy my green peppers!”</p>

<p class='c005'>None of the Taoltecs hindered him, because the hill
people, from Uro and Hipal and Thiapas, were used
to come into Porutsa almost thus lightly clad; and it
was evident enough that this fair-skinned stranger,
with the bare, great, round, pink head, came unarmed
with anything except the equipments of nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth sold his peppers, and went striding about the
market-place inquiring for news of Dom Manuel, but
none of these charcoal- and copper-colored persons
seemed ever to have heard of the gray champion.
When the market for that day was over, Coth went up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>into the hills about Tzatzitepec, in company with a full-bosomed,
brown-eyed, delicious girl who had been selling
water-cresses in the market-place: she proved brisk;
and Coth spent four days with her to their mutual contentment.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the fifth day he returned, still naked as his
mother bore him, to the market-place in Porutsa; and
there he again sold green peppers, so that this brow-beating
Yaotl might have no least doubt as to the value
which Coth set on this god’s patronage.</p>

<p class='c005'>And all went well enough for a while. But by and
by seven soldiers came into the market-place, and so to
where Coth had just disposed of the last bunch of peppers;
and the leader of these soldiers said, “Our Emperor
desires speech with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” Coth returned, “I am through with my day’s
work, and I can conveniently spare him a moment or
two.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He went affably with these soldiers, and they led
him to the Emperor Vemac. “Who are you?” said
the Emperor, first of all, “and what is your business
in Porutsa?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am an outlander called Coth of the Rocks, a dealer
in green peppers, and I came hither to sell my green
peppers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But why do you come into my city wearing no
blanket and no loin-cloth and, in fact, nothing whatever
except a scowl?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“That is because of a refrainment which was put
upon me by an impudent black rascal who carried arrows
and a fan with a mirror in it, and who called himself
Yaotl.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Blessed be the name of that god!” said the pious
Emperor Vemac, “although we worship the Feathered
Serpent, and not the Capricious Lord.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Vemac went on to explain that he had an only
daughter, who five days earlier had observed Coth,
first from the windows of the palace, and later had
gone down veiled into the market-place in order to
regard at closer quarters this virtually pink person.
She had returned, astounded and in some excitement,
to demand of her father that he give her this queerly
colored and greatly gifted seller of peppers to be her
husband. Vemac granted her request, because he never
denied his daughter anything, and ardently desired a
grandson: but when they sent to look for the pink-colored
pepper vendor with the great and hairless, pink-colored
head, he was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Princess Utsume had taken this disappointment,
with its attendant delay of her nuptials, rather hard.
In fine, said Vemac, the girl had fallen sick with love,
six physicians had been able to do nothing for her,
and nobody could heal her, she declared, except that
beautifully tinted and in all ways magnificent pepper
vendor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, you must tell the poor girl that I already have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>a wife,” said Coth, “even over and above an understanding
with a seller of water-cresses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not,” Vemac submitted, “see what that has to
do with it. In Tollan a man is permitted as many
wives as he cares to have, within, of course, reason.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marrying does not come under the head of reason,”
said Coth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, as the husband of my only child,” said
Vemac, “you will rule over Tollan along with me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! oh!” said Coth. For, since he had punctiliously
disobeyed Yaotl in everything, he knew this must
be a coincidence, and it seemed a very strange coincidence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And, finally,” said Vemac, “if you are hard-headed
about this really excellent opening in life for a green
pepper vendor, we shall have to persuade you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But how,” asked Coth, reservedly, “how would you
persuade me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vemac raised his brown hand. His persuaders came,
masked, and bringing with them their implements and
a stalwart male slave. They demonstrated their methods
of persuasion; and after what remained of the
slave was quiet at last, Coth also for a while remained
quiet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of two evils,” Coth said then, “one should choose
the more familiar. I will marry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He let them take him and bathe him and trim his
long mustachios and dye his body black and perfume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>him and set upon his great bald head a coronal of white
hens’ feathers. A red cloth was wrapped about his
loins, upon his feet a priest put painted sandals with
little golden bells fastened to them, and about Coth’s
scented body was placed a mantle of yellow netting
very beautifully fringed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” said Vemac, “when you have had supper,
do you go in there and comfort my daughter in her
sickness!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth obeyed, and found the princess—who proved
to be in an unmitigatedly brunette fashion a most
charming girl,—recumbent and weeping in a solidly
built double-bed. Coth hung upon a peg in the wall his
coronal of white hens’ feathers, he coughed, and he
looked again at the weeping princess.</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth said: “By such an attachment to me, my dear,
I am touched. An attachment to me, in this land of
half-men, is indicative of sound sense.” He coughed
again, perhaps to hide his emotion, and he added: “An
attachment to me is moving. So do you move over!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She, still weeping, made room for him. He sat down
upon the bed and began to comfort her. She in turn
began to express her appreciation of this comforting.
He hung upon a peg in the wall a mantle of yellow netting,
and a red loin-cloth.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the morning no trace whatever remained of the
Princess Utsume’s illness except a great and agreeable
fatigue. And in the forenoon Coth was married to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Princess Utsumé and escorted to the temple of the
Feathered Serpent, and there given the imperial name
Toveyo, and he was crowned as the co-ruler along with
Vemac over all Tollan.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet afterward a rather curious ceremony—called, as
his brown loving bride informed Toveyo, the Feast
of Brooms,—was enacted by the clergy and the entire
populace of Porutsa, in order to ensure for the marriage
of their princess fertility.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I feel that this ceremony is superfluous,” Utsumé
said, still yawning. “But this ceremony was divinely
ordained by the Goddess of Dirt; and I feel, too, my
wonderful pink darling, that it is becoming for persons
of our exalted rank to encourage all true religious sentiment,
and generally to consent that the will of the gods
be done.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile these rites had opened with the beheading
of a quite handsome young woman, from whose body
the skin was then removed, in two sections, like a horrid
corselet and trousers. As such they were worn each
by a priest during the rest of the ceremony: and about
this Feast of Brooms the less said, the better, but to
the newly christened Toveyo a great deal of it seemed
morbid and even a bit immodest.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>TOVEYO’S first official act was to send ambassadors
to the kings in that neighborhood—to
Cocox and Napaltzin and Acolhua, the second
of that name,—but none of these could give him any
news of Dom Manuel. Meanwhile Coth cherished his
wife and dealt with other persons also according to his
nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of his somewhat remarkable behavior in the war
with Cacat and Coät, of how in one of his rages he destroyed
a bridge with all the people on it, and of how
he killed ten of his subjects with a gardener’s hoe, there
is in this place no need to speak. But it came about
unavoidably that, before Coth’s honeymoon was over, a
deputation from the Taoltecs was beseeching Vemac
to have this son-in-law of his unostentatiously assassinated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For there is really,” they said, “no standing him
and his tantrums.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such,” Vemac replied, “has been my own experience.
I am afraid, though, that if we kill him my
daughter will be put out, for she seems to have discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>about him some feature or another feature of
great and unfailing attractiveness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is better, majesty, that she should weep than
that we all be driven mad. The man’s pride and self-conceit
are unbearable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nobody knows that better than I do. He hectors
me in my own palace, where I am not accustomed to
be overrun by anybody except my daughter. In such
a position we must be politic. We must first see that
this Toveyo is belittled in my daughter’s eyes. Afterward,
if I know her as well as I think I do, she will
consent to let us get rid of him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>One of the darker Taoltecs, who called himself Tal-Cavêpan,
said then: “This all-overbearing Toveyo is
now in the market-place. Follow me, and you shall see
him belittled in his wife’s eyes and in the eyes of
everybody!”</p>

<p class='c005'>They followed, inquiring among themselves who
might be this huge Tal-Cavêpan, that he spoke so
boldly. Nobody remembered having seen him before.
Meanwhile Tal-Cavêpan went up to where Coth and
his royal wife Utsumé were chaffering with a Yopi
huckster over some melons. Tal-Cavêpan clapped his
hand to Coth’s shoulder and bore down with this hand.
Coth became smaller and smaller, so that presently
Tal-Cavêpan stooped and picked up the nuisance whom
they called Toveyo, and thus displayed to the Taoltecs
their blustering oppressor as a pink midget not more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>than four inches high, standing there in the palm of
Tal-Cavêpan’s black hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dance, majesty! dance, dreadful potentate!” said
Tal-Cavêpan. And Coth danced for them. All the
while that he danced, he swore very horribly, and his
little voice was like the cheeping of a young bird.</p>

<p class='c005'>The people crowded about him, because no such
wonder-working had ever before been seen in Porutsa.
Tal-Cavêpan cried merrily to Vemac the Emperor, “Is
not this capering son-in-law of yours belittled in his
wife’s eyes and in the eyes of everybody?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vemac called out to his guards, “Kill this sorcerer!”</p>

<p class='c005'>His soldiers obeyed the Emperor. But the Princess
Utsumé caught up her tiny husband and thrust him
into the bosom of her purple gown, out of harm’s way,
the while that Tal-Cavêpan was being enthusiastically
despatched.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the huge body of Tal-Cavêpan lay where
it had fallen, and it instantly began to corrupt,
and from it arose a most astounding stench.
“Take that devil carrion out of my city!” Vemac commanded
his guards, “lest it breed a pestilence in Porutsa.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But when they attempted again to obey the Emperor,
they found the body was so heavy that no force could
raise it from the ground. So the Taoltecs of necessity
left this corpse in their market-place. And a pestilence,
in the form of a small yellow whirlwind, went stealthily
about the city; and many hundreds died.</p>

<p class='c005'>Those who yet remained in life, now that they were
not able to help themselves, prayed for help from the
Feathered Serpent, and, at each of the seven holy stations,
sacrificed to him suckling children decked with
bands and streamers of properly colored paper. But
the pestilence continued.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Taoltecs then made a yet handsomer oblation,
of plump and really valuable slaves and of captive warriors,
each one of whom had been duly painted with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>blue-and-gilt stripes; and they offered the hearts of all
these to their older and somewhat outmoded gods, to
the Slayer with the Left Hand and to the Maker of
Sprouts. Then, as the pestilence grew worse, they became
desperate, and they experimentally decapitated
and flayed eight of the lesser nobility in honor of the
new god called Yaotl, the Capricious Lord, the Enemy
upon Both Sides.</p>

<p class='c005'>Forthwith the dead Tal-Cavêpan raised up what was
left of his countenance, and he said: “Fasten to me
ropes woven of black and of red cords, you worshipers
of the Feathered Serpent! And when fifty of you
have done so-and-so,”—he stipulated very exactly what
they were to do, each to the other,—“then do you drag
my body to the Place of the Dead, which is Yaotl’s
place; and there let my body be burned upon his altar.
So shall this pestilence be ended.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Taoltecs obeyed. Fifty of them, forming a circle,
shamefacedly did the abomination which was required,
and fifty of them tugged at the parti-colored
ropes: but still the corpse could not be moved. Tal-Cavêpan
spoke again, saying, “Fetch Vemac, that Emperor
who decreed my death!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vemac came, and along with him, came his daughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hail, Vemac, son of Imos, of the line of Chan,
and of the race of Chivim!” said the corpse. “It appears
that these puny sons of nobodies, enfeebled by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>their long worship of the Feathered Serpent, are not
able—after one little act of homage to the Capricious
Lord,—to remove me from this city. It is therefore
necessary that their broad-shouldered and heavenly descended
Emperor draw my body to the Place of the
Dead, and there burn my body upon the altar of
Yaotl.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What will become of me in the Place of the Dead?”
Vemac asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>The corpse smiled. “From that holy place the Emperor
will depart on a long journey. His son-in-law
will thereafter reign, as was foretold, over all Tollan.
For the Emperor Vemac will be traveling afar, he will
be journeying between two mountains and beyond the
lair of the snake and the crocodile, even to the Nine
Waters, which he will cross upon the back of a red
dog. Nor will the Emperor Vemac ever return from
that journeying.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vemac shivered a little. But he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is right that an emperor should die rather than
his people perish. I will not degrade my body, but
your body I will draw to the Place of the Dead; and
I will abide what follows.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Coth cried out, like the cheeping of a bird, from
where he sat in the bosom of his wife’s gown. “This
sort of talk is very well, but what assurance have we
that this dung-pile is speaking the truth?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The corpse answered: “To you, Toveyo, I swear that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>when the Emperor of Tollan has drawn my body to the
Place of the Dead, the pestilence will cease: and I swear
too that the Emperor will never return. Thus shall
his son-in-law reign in his stead, precisely as was foretold.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oho!” said Coth, “so it is as I thought, and nobody
guarantees the affair but you! Well, now, upon
my word, do you take us for buzzards or for scavengers,
that we should in any way be bothering about
what emanates from you! By what oath can garbage
swear, that anybody should heed it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The great corpse stirred restively under the midget’s
piping taunts. But the voice of Tal-Cavêpan said only,
“I swear by the oath of the Star Warriors, even by the
Word of the Tzitzi-Mimé.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, ah!” said Coth. “Put me down, dear little
wife!” Then Coth, the very tiny pink mannikin, strutted
toward the evil-smelling black corpse, and brown
Utsumé followed fondly after him. Coth posed in a
majestic attitude, resting one elbow upon his wife’s instep,
and twirling at his mustachios. Coth said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have sworn to these things, Yaotl, by that unbreakable
oath of yours which first started all this trouble.
Very well! I am co-emperor of Tollan. I am as
much emperor as Vemac is: and it is I who will draw
you to the burning you have richly earned; and it is I
whom your oath will prevent from ever returning into
this infernal Porutsa, where such uncalled-for liberties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>are taken with a person’s size, and the people are
very much too fond of dancing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” said the corpse, “I meant the other emperor!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth answered: “Bosh! Nobody cares what you
meant, it matters only what you have sworn.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” said the corpse, “but, you pernicious pink
shrimp—!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth replied, “I do not deny that you spoke lightly:
even so, you did swear it, by an unbreakable oath; and
the affair is concluded.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth caught at the parti-colored ropes with tiny fingers.
But as he tugged, Coth began to grow. The
harder he pulled, the greater became his stature, in
order that the honor of the Capricious Lord might stay
undisgraced, and Yaotl not be evicted from Porutsa by
a midget. And now the corpse moved. Now the Taoltecs
saw hauling doggedly at those black and red ropes
a full-grown if somewhat short-legged champion, with
a remarkably large and glistening pink head: before
him went a little yellow whirlwind, and behind him
dragged a dreadful black corruption. Thus Coth passed
through the east gate of their city.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The will of the gods be done!” said Vemac,—“especially
when it is in every way a very good riddance.”
Nobody dissented with his pious utterance. “Let the
city gates be closed!” said Vemac then. “Put new bolts
on them, lest that son-in-law of mine be coming back
to us against the will of the gods. And you, my dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Utsumé, since you alone are losing anything, howsoever
happily, by this business, you shall have another
husband, of less desultory dimensions, and, in fact,
you may have as many husbands as you like, my darling,
to raise up an heir for us in Porutsa and an emperor
to come after me and rule over all Tollan.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Utsumé replied: “I have reason to believe, my revered
father, that the matter of an heir has been attended
to. I shall regret my pink Toveyo and his great
natural gifts, which were to me as a tireless fountain
of delights. And I shall honor his memory by always
marrying somebody as near like him as it may be possible
to find in this degenerate country. Meanwhile I
quite agree with you that it is becoming for persons of
our exalted rank to encourage all true religious sentiment,
and generally to consent that the will of the
gods be done.”</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>IN the Place of the Dead, Yaotl sat up and scratched
his nose reflectively. The Capricious Lord had
put off the putrid appearance of Tal-Cavêpan. He
now had the seeming which is his in the heaven called
Tamo-Anchan: and as he sat opposite the black stone
idol there was no difference between Yaotl and the
image of Yaotl. At the god’s navel also shone a green
jewel, his face was striped with yellow, and from his
ears hung rings of gold and silver. Otherwise he wore
nothing at all, but in one hand he carried arrows, and
in his other hand was the scrying-stone with long feathers
of three differing colors set about it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will now,” said Yaotl, “reveal to you the third
refrainment which was put upon you. It was that you
must never obey my commands in anything.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That,” Coth replied, hotly, “is not a fair refrainment.
It gives me no chance to treat you as you deserve.
It is a refrainment which strikes directly at the
doctrine of free will. It is a treacherous and vile refrainment!
For if you will consider just for a moment,—you
black and very dull-witted dancing-master!—even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>you will see that, by commanding any self-respecting
person to do the exact contrary of your most
absurd and tyrannical wishes—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had considered that,” said Yaotl, dryly. “It was
quite necessary I should retain some little protection
for my real wishes in the lands over which I exercise
divine power.” Now the Capricious Lord fell into a
silence, out of which by and by bubbled a chuckle.
“Well, you tricked me neatly enough, just now, when
I was in train to make you the sole ruler over this country.
And I was going to have a rather pleasant forenoon,
too, with that Vemac! Still, I did make you
an emperor: and I have kept in everything the oath of
the Star Warriors. So the affair is concluded: I am
released from my oath; and you may now return to
that home of yours, where people have, in some unimaginable
fashion, learned how to put up with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall not give over my searching of the West,”
Coth answered, stubbornly, “until I have found my
liege-lord, whom I intend to fetch back into Poictesme.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But that will never do, because we really must preserve
hereabouts some sort of order and rule! And
no man nor any deity can hope for actual ease in Tollan
as long as you are blustering about like a bald-headed
pink hornet.... So do you let me think the
thought of the Most High Place of the Gods, and take
counsel with the will of Teotex-Calli. About this Dom
Manuel of yours, for instance—”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Yaotl sat quite still for a moment, thinking and looking
into the scrying-stone. And his thought, which
was the thought of the Most High Place of the Gods
of Tollan, took form there very slowly as a gray smoke;
and a little by a little this pallid smoke assumed the appearance
of a tall gray man, clad all in silvery gray
armor, and displaying upon his shield the silver emblem
of Poictesme: and Coth knelt before his master,
in Yaotl’s Place of the Dead.</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>“COTH” said the voice of Manuel, “most stubborn
and perverse of all that served me! Coth,
that must always serve me grudgingly, with so
much of grumbling and of ill grace and of more valor!
So, is it you, Coth, is it you, bald-headed, gruff
growler!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth answered: “It is I, master, who am come to
fetch you back into Poictesme. And I take it very ill,
let me tell you quite frankly, sir, that you should be
expressing any surprise to see me in my place and about
my proper duty! I follow, as my oath was, after the
captain of the Fellowship of the Silver Stallion. They
tell me that the fellowship is dissolved by your wife’s
orders. Well, we both know what wives are. We
know, moreover, that my oath was to follow you and
to serve you. So I take it that such surprise in the
matter comes from you most unbecomingly: and that
much, master or not, I wish you distinctly to understand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Manuel said: “You follow me across the world
and over the world’s rim because of that oath, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>pester these gods into summoning me from my last
home, and then you begin forthwith to bluster at me!
Yes, this is Coth, who serves me just as he did
of old. What of the others who swore with you,
Coth?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They thrive, master. They thrive, and they listen
to small poets caterwauling about you, in those fine
fiefs and castles which you gave them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you only, the least honored and the most rebellious
of my barons, have followed me even to this
far Place of the Dead! Coth, yet you also had your
lands and your two castles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, they will keep! What do you mean by hinting
that anybody will dare in my absence to meddle
with my property! Did I not pick up an empire here
with no trouble at all! You are casting reflections, sir,
upon my valor and ability, which, I must tell you quite
frankly, and for your own good—!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Manuel was speaking, rather sadly. “Coth, that
which you have done because of your given word was
very nobly done, and with heroic unreason. Coth, you
are heroic, but the others are wise.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Master, there was an oath.” Coth’s voice now
broke a little. “Master, it was not only the oath.
There was a great love, also, in a worsening land,
where lesser persons ruled, and there remained nobody
like Manuel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Manuel said: “The others are wise. You follow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>still the Manuel who went about Poictesme. Now in
Poictesme all are forgetting that Manuel, and our poets
are busied with quite another Manuel, and my own wife
has builded a great tomb for that other Manuel....
Coth, that is always so. It is love, not carelessness,
which bids us forget our dead, so that we may love
them the more whole-heartedly. Unwelcome memories
must be recolored and reshaped, the faults and blunders
and the vexing ways which are common to all men
must be put out of mind, and strange excellencies must
be added, until the compound in nothing resembles the
man that is dead. Such is love’s way, Coth, to keep
love immortal.... Coth, oh, most bungling Coth!”
said Manuel, very tenderly, “you lack the grace even
to honor your loved dead in a decorous and wise
fashion!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I follow the true Manuel,” Coth replied, “because
to do that was my oath. There was involved, I cannot
deny it, sir, some affection.” Coth gulped. “I, for
the rest, am not interested in these new-fangled, fine lies
they are telling about you nowadays.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then there was silence. A small wind went about
the pepper plants; and it seemed to whisper of perished
things.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Manuel said: “Coth, I repeat to you, the others
are wise. I have gone, forever. But another Manuel
abides in Poictesme, and he is nourished by these fictions.
Yearly he grows in stature, this Manuel who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>redeemed Poictesme from the harsh Northmen’s oppression
and lewd savagery. Already this Manuel the Redeemer
has become a most notable hero, without fear or
guile or any other blemish: and with each generation
he will increase in virtue. It is this dear Redeemer
whom Poictesme will love and emulate: men will be
braver because this Manuel was so very brave; and men,
in one or another moment of temptation, will refrain
from folly because his wisdom was so well rewarded;
and—sometimes, at least,—a few men will refrain from
baseness, too, because all his living was stainless.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I,” Coth said, heavily, “do not recall this Manuel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor do I recall him either, old grumbler. I can
remember only one who dealt with each obligation as
he best might, and that was always rather inefficiently.
I remember many doings which I would prefer not to
remember. And I remember a soiled struggler who
reeled blunderingly from one half-solved riddle to another,
thwarted and vexed, and hiding very jealously
his hurt.... Well, it is better that such a person
should be forgotten! And so I come from my last
home to release you from your oath of service. I release
you now, forever, dear Coth, and I now bid you do
as all the others have done, and I now lay upon you
my last orders. I order that you too forget me, Coth,
as those have forgotten who might have known me
better than you did.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Coth said, with a queer noise which was embarrassingly
like a sob: “I cannot forget the most dear and
admirable of earthly lords. You are requiring, sir, the
impossible.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nevertheless, it is necessary that you too—bald realist!—should
serve this other Manuel; and should forget,
as your fellows have forgotten, that muddied and
not ever quite efficient bull-necked straggler who has
gone out of life and vigor and out of all persons’ memory.
For now is come upon me my last obligation:
it is that the figure which I made in the world shall not
endure anywhere in any particle; and I accept this obligation
also, and I submit to the common lot of all men,
without struggling any longer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth said, “Return to us, dear master! return, and
with the brave truth do you make an end of your people’s
bragging and vain lies!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Manuel said: “No. For Poictesme has now, as
every land must have, its faith and its legend, to lead
men more nobly and more valorously than ever any
living man may do. I, who was strong, had not the
strength to beget this legend: but it has been created,
Coth, it has been created by the folly of a woman and
the wild babble of a frightened child; and it will endure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth replied, brokenly: “But, master, we are men
of this world, a world made of dirt. Oh, my dear master,
we pick our way about that dirt as we best can! The results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>need surprise nobody. The results are rather
often, in a pathetic fashion, very admirable. Should
this truth be disregarded for a vainglorious dream!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Manuel answered: “The dream is better. For
man alone of animals plays the ape to his dreams.”</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>HERE Yaotl ended thinking, and put aside the
scrying-stone. And his thought was no longer
of Manuel, and nothing was apparent in the
Place of the Dead save Yaotl and the image of Yaotl
and Coth standing there, in the apparel of an emperor,
alone and small and remarkably subdued looking, between
the vast black naked twins.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It would appear,” said Yaotl, “that some men are
no more tractable than are the gods when the affair
concerns a keeping of oaths. And so Toveyo will be
remembered in this land for a long while.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Coth answered, rather drearily: “Yes; it is such
fools as you and I, Messire Yaotl, who create unnecessary
trouble everywhere. Well, I also am now released
from my oath! And my master has spoken bitter good
sense. The famousness of Manuel is but a dream and
a loud jingling of words which happen to sound well
together; it is a vanity and a great talking by his old
wife and my gray peers: and yet, this nonsense, it may
be, will hearten people, and will serve all people always,
better than would the truth. And my faith is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>foolishness, in that, because of a mere oath,—like your
Star Warriors’ Word of the Thingumajigs, sir,—I
have followed after the truth, across this windy planet
upon which every person is nourished by one or another
lie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Each to his creed,” said Yaotl. “So do men choose
between hope and despair.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet creeds mean very little,” Coth answered the
dark god, still speaking almost gently. “The optimist
proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds;
and the pessimist fears this is true. So I elect for
neither label. I merely know that, at the end of all
my journeying, there remains for me only to settle
down, in my comfortable castles yonder in Poictesme,
and to live contentedly with my fine-looking wife Azra
and with my son Jurgen,—that innocent dear lad, whom
his old hypocrite of a father will by and by, beyond any
doubt, be exhorting to imitate a Manuel who never
lived! And I know, too, that this is not the ending
which I would have chosen for my saga. For I also,
I suppose, must now decline into fat ease and high
thinking, and I would have preferred the truth.” Coth
meditated for a while: he shrugged: and he laughed
without hilarity. “Capricious Lord, I pray you, what
sort of creatures do men seem to the gods?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let us think of more pleasant matters,” Yaotl replied.
“For one, I am already thinking of the way in
which I can most speedily get you, O insatiable grumbler,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>again to your far home, and out of my too long
afflicted country.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned his naked huge back toward Coth, as Coth
supposed, to indulge in meditation. Coth, was, however,
almost instantly disabused, by a miracle.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the tale, for one reason and another, does
not record the miracle which Yaotl performed.
The Gods of Tollan were always apt to be
misled by their queer notions of humor. Instead, the
tale is of that Poictesme to which—borne by that favorable
if malodorous wind which Yaotl provided and
aimed,—Coth now perforce returned alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the years of Coth’s absence there had been
many changes. Nominally it was the Countess Niafer
who ruled over this land, but she in everything seemed
to be controlled by St. Holmendis of Philistia. About
the intimacy between the Countess and her lean but
sturdy adviser there was now no longer any gossip nor
shrugging: people had grown used to this alliance, just
as they were becoming reconciled to the reforms and
the prohibitions which were its fruitage.</p>

<p class='c005'>For now that Manuel was gone, Coth found, the
times were changing for the better at a most uncomfortable
rate. To Coth of the Rocks these days seemed
to breed littler men, who, to be sure, if you cared about
such kickshaws, lived more decorously than had lived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>their fathers, now that this overbearing St. Holmendis
had come out of Philistia with his miracles: for this
sacrosanct person would put up with no irregularity
anywhere, and would hardly so much as tolerate the
mildest form of wonder-working by anybody else.
Even Guivric the Sage, who in the elder and more candid
times had attended to all of Dom Manuel’s conjuring,
now found it expedient to restrict his thaumaturgies
to a wholly confidential practice.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the rest, you could go for days now without encountering
a warlock or a fairy; the people of Audela
but rarely came out of the fire to make sport for and
with mankind; and, while many persons furtively
brewed spells at home, all traffic with spirits had to be
conducted secretly. In fine, Poictesme was everywhere
upon its most sedate behavior, because there was no
telling when Holy Holmendis might be dealing with
you for your own good; and the cowed province, just
as Guivric had prophesied, stayed subject nowadays to
a robustious saint conceived and nurtured and made
holy in Philistia.</p>

<p class='c005'>But yet another unsettling influence was abroad, nefariously
laboring to keep everybody sanctimonious and
genteel,—Coth said,—for over the entire land Coth
found, and fretted under, the all-enveloping legend of
Manuel the Redeemer. Coth found the land’s most
holy place, now, to be that magnificent tomb which, in
Coth’s absence, the Countess Niafer had reared at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Storisende to the memory of her husband. And that
this architectural perjury was handsome enough, even
Coth admitted.</p>

<p class='c005'>The intricately carved lower half of the sepulchre
displayed eight alcoves in each of which was sealed the
relic of one or another saint. The upper portion was
the pedestal of a very fine equestrian statue of Dom
Manuel with his lance raised, and in full armor, but
wearing no helmet, so that the hero’s face was visible
as he sat there, waiting, it seemed, and watching the
North. Thus Manuel appeared to keep eternal guard
against whatever enemy might dare molest the country
which he had once redeemed from the Northmen. And
there was never a more splendid looking champion than
was this mimic Manuel, for the armor of this effigy was
everywhere inset with jewels of every kind and color.</p>

<p class='c005'>How Madame Niafer, who was, moreover, by ordinary
a notably parsimonious person, had ever managed
to pay for all these gems nobody could declare with
certainty, but it was believed that Holy Holmendis had
provided them through one or another pious miracle.
Coth of the Rocks voiced an exasperated aspersion that
they were paste; and declared paste gems to be wholly
appropriate to the mortuary imposture. In any event,
the Redeemer of Poictesme had been accorded the most
magnificent sepulchre these parts had ever known.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Coth found all this jewelry and tortured stone-work,
as a work of art, to be wholly admirable, if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>cared for such kickshaws. But as a tomb he considered
it to lack at least one essential feature, in that it was
empty.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet to most persons the emptiness of the great tomb
was its peculiar sanctity. This spacious and proud glittering
void was, to most persons, a perpetual reminder
that Dom Manuel had ascended into heaven while yet
alive, uncorrupted by the ignominy of death, and taking
with him every heroic bone and bit of flesh, and
every tiniest sinew, unmarred. That miracle—no more,
to be sure, than the great Redeemer’s just due—most
satisfactorily and most awfully accounted for the lack
of any corpse, as surely as the lack of a corpse was the
firm proof of the miracle; sublime verities here interlocked:
and that miracle had been set above cavil when
it was first revealed, by Heaven’s wisdom, through the
unsullied innocence of a little child, lest in this world,
men and women being what they are, by any scoffer
the testimony of an adult evangelist might be suspected.</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth, after hearing these axioms,—so unshakably
established as axioms during the seven years of Coth’s
absence,—would look meditatively at his young Jurgen,
to whose extreme youth and comparative innocence this
revelation had been accorded. The boy was now nearing
manhood, he fell short in many respects of the virtues
appropriate to an evangelist, and he confessed to remembering
very faintly now that tremendous experience
of his infancy. That hardly mattered, though, Coth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>would reflect, when Poictesme at large was so industriously
preserving and embroidering the tale which the
dear brat had brought down from Upper Morven to explain
away an over-night truancy from home.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is but one Manuel,” Coth would remark, to
himself, “and—of all persons!—my Jurgen is his
prophet. That kickshaw creed seems to content everybody,
now that the rogue no longer bothers to provide
an excuse for staying out all night.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>EVERYWHERE, indeed, during the while of
Coth’s vain adventuring after the real Manuel,
the legend had grown steadily. Coth found it
wholly maddening to hear of the infallible and perfect
Redeemer with whom he had formerly lived in daily
converse of a painstakingly quarrelsome and uncivil nature:
and he found too that, of his confrères of the
Silver Stallion who yet remained in Poictesme, Ninzian
and Donander at least were beginning to lie about Manuel
with as pious a lack of restraint as anybody. Guivric
the Sage, of course, would chillily assent to whatsoever
the best-thought-of people affirmed, because the
self-centered old knave did not ever really bother about
what other persons thought: whereas Holden and Anavalt
sought, rather markedly, to turn the conversation
to other topics. These aging champions had, in fine,
encountered, in this legend as to their former glories
and privileges, an unconquerable adversary with which
they, each according to his nature, were of necessity
compromising.</p>

<p class='c005'>For Manuel the great Redeemer, who had first carnally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>redeemed Poictesme in battle with the Northmen,
and later had redeemed Poictesme in more exalted fields,
when at his passing he had taken all his people’s sins
upon his proud gray head,—this Manuel was to return
and was to bring again with him the golden age which,
everybody now asserted, had existed under Manuel’s
ruling of Poictesme. That was the sweet and reason-drugging
allure of the legend, that was the prediction
transmitted by Coth’s young scapegrace, who nowadays
had averted so whole-heartedly from prophecy to petticoats.
There was no sense in arguing against such
vaticinatory fanfaronade, since it promised to all inefficient
persons that which they preferred to believe in.
Everywhere in the world people were expecting the
latter coming of one or another kickshaw messiah who
would remove the discomforts which they themselves
were either too lazy or too incompetent to deal with;
and nobody had anything whatever to gain by electing
for peculiarity among one’s fellow creatures and a
gloomier outlook.</p>

<p class='c005'>Even Coth saw that. So the bald realist looked over
his cellar and the later produce among his vassals in
the way of likely girls; he gave such orders as seemed
best in the light of both inspections; and he settled down
as comfortably as might be to the task of making old
bones in this land of madmen. He might at least look
forward to the requisite creature comforts to be derived
from these bins and amiable spry bedfellows. His Azra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>was no more trying than most wives; and his young
Jurgen, after all, might turn out better than seemed
probable.</p>

<p class='c005'>So Coth in the end let maudlin imbeciles proclaim
whatsoever they elected about the glorious stay upon
earth and the second coming of Manuel the Redeemer,
and Coth answered them at worst with inarticulate
growlings. But that the old bear’s love for Poictesme
remained unchanged was evinced by the zeal with which
he now caused his two homes superabundantly to be
adorned with the arms of Poictesme, so that at every
turn your eye fell upon the rampant silver stallion and
the land’s famous motto, <i>Mundus vult decipi</i>. Such
patriotism showed, said everybody, that, for all his fault-finding,
Coth’s heart was in the right place.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>AND the tale is still of Coth, telling how he avoided
Niafer’s court, and the decorums and the pieties
which were in fashion there, and how he
debauched reasonably in his own citadels.</p>

<p class='c005'>He fought no more, but he did not lack for other
pleasures. He hunted in the Forest of Acaire; and,
in his rich coat of fox fur, he rode frequently with
hounds and falcons about the plains of the Roigne.
He maintained an excellent pit in which wild boars
and bears contended and killed one another for his diversion.
When the weather was warm he drank, and
he amused himself at dice and backgammon in his well-ordered
orchard: in winter he sat snug under the carved
hood of his huge fireplace; and it was thus that for his
health’s sake he was cozily cupped and bled, while the
Alderman of St. Didol drank quietly and insatiably.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, too, it amused Coth now and then to execute
a vassal or so upon his handsome gallows,—that notorious
gallows supported with four posts, although
his rank as Alderman entitled him to only two posts,—because
this bit of arrogance, in the matter of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>two extra posts, was a continuous great source of anger
to his nominal sovereign, Madame Niafer. But his
main recreation, after all, Coth found in emulating
those very ancient and most famous monarchs Jupiter
and David in a constant change of women; and the
fine girls of Poictesme remained as always a lively joy
to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>And daily, too, the Alderman of St. Didol squabbled
with his wife and son; and, since he could discover
profuse grounds everywhere for fault-finding, was
comfortable enough.</p>

<p class='c005'>To his sardonic bent it was at this period amusing
to note how staidly Poictesme thrived by virtue of the
land’s faith in Poictesme’s Redeemer, who had removed
all troubles and obligations in the past, and who
by and by would be coming again, no doubt to wipe
similarly clean the moral slate; so that there was no
real need to worry about the future, nor about any little
personal misdemeanor (which had not become embarrassingly
public), since this would of course be included
in the general amnesty when Manuel returned
to take charge of his people’s affairs.</p>

<p class='c005'>And yet there was another and more troubling side.
The younger, here and there, were beginning, within
moderation, to emulate that Manuel who had never
lived. For Coth saw that too. He saw young persons—here
and there,—displaying traits and customs strange
if not virtually unknown to the old reprobate’s varied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>experience. Civility, for one thing, was rather sickeningly
pandemic: you saw fine strapping lads, differing
in opinion about this, that or the other, who, instead
of resorting sensibly to a duel, stopped—who positively
sat down side by side—to examine each the other’s
point of view, and after that, as often as not, talked
themselves out of fighting at all. That was because of
the fame of Manuel’s uniform civility, which, indeed,
the rogue had displayed, and had made excellent profit
of.</p>

<p class='c005'>But you saw, too, people pardoning and even befriending
persons who had affronted or injured them,
and doing this because of the fame of Manuel’s loving
kindliness toward his fellows: everywhere you saw that
wholly groundless notion flowering also into a squeamishness
about taking any other person’s property away
from him, even when you really wanted it. You saw
bodily sound young men avoiding, or at any rate stinting,
the normal pleasures of youth, alike among their
peers and in bed, because of the famousness of Dom
Manuel’s sobriety and chastity: and you saw milksops,
in fine, giving up all the really intelligent vices because
of that slanderous rumor about Manuel’s addiction
to the virtues.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not, either—not altogether,—that the young
fools thought they had much to gain by these eccentricities.
They had, somehow, been tempted into emulation
by this nonsense about Manuel’s virtues. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>then they had—still somehow, still quite unexplainably,—found
pleasure in it. Coth granted this rather
forlornly: these young people were getting a calm and
temperate, but a positive, gratification out of being
virtuous. There must, then, lurk somewhere deep hidden
in humanity a certain trend to perverse delight in
thus denying and curbing its own human appetites.
And since the comparatively intelligent and unregenerate
persons were all profiting by their fellows’ increased
forbearance, altogether everybody was reaping benefit.</p>

<p class='c005'>This damnable new generation was, because of its
insane aspiring, happier than its fathers had been under
the reign of candor and common-sense. This moonstruck
legend of Manuel was bringing, not to be sure
any omnipresent and unendurable perfection, but an
undeniable increase of tranquillity and contentment to
all Poictesme. Coth saw that too.</p>

<p class='c005'>He remembered what his true liege-lord had said
to him in the Place of the Dead: and Coth admitted
that, say what you might as to the Manuel who had
really lived, the squinting rascal did as a rule know
what he was talking about.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Coth, for his Jurgen’s benefit, piously indicated
the motto which you encountered at well-nigh
every turn in Coth’s two homes, along with the stallion
rampant in every member.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nevertheless, Coth was unhappier than he showed.
He had loved Anavalt in the days when these two had
served together under the banner of the Silver Stallion.
It seemed to Coth that in dark Elfhame a handsome
and fine-spoken and kindly rascal had been trapped and
devoured rather wastefully. Nor was it cheering to
consider that, now, but five of the great fellowship remained
alive.... Meanwhile, in rearing a son judiciously,
one must preserve the proper moral tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Coth heard also, at about this time, of the magic
which had been put upon King Helmas the Deep-Minded,
that monarch whom, as people said, Dom
Manuel in the old days had bamboozled into giving
Manuel a fine start in life. Coth heard of how this
magic had been put upon Helmas by his own daughter
Mélusine, and of the notable transfer of the king’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>castle and person and entire entourage from out of
Albania to the high place at Brunbelois, in the impenetrable
Forest of Acaire, where the ill-fated court of
Helmas now all stayed enchanted, people said.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Coth drew the moral. “It shows you what parents
may expect of their children,” he remarked, with
a malevolent glance toward his adored Jurgen. “It
shows you what comes of this habit of indulging children.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, Father—” said the boy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stop storming at me! How dare you attempt to
bulldoze me, sir! Do you take me for another Helmas!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Father—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get out of my sight, you quarrelsome puppy! I will
not be thus deafened. Get back to that Dorothy of
yours! You care for nobody else,” said jealous old
Coth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, Father—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And must you still be arguing with me! Do you
think there is no end to my patience? What is there to
argue about? The puppy follows the bitch. That is
natural.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Father, how can you—!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get out of my sight before I break every bone in
your body! Get back to that cold sanctimonious court
and to your hot wench!” said Coth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet all the while that he spoke with such fluency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Coth’s heart was troubled. Of course, in rearing a son
judiciously, one must preserve the proper moral tone.
Nevertheless, Coth felt, at heart, that he might be taking
the wrong way with the boy, and was being almost
brusque.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Coth was Coth. That was his doom. He had
only one way.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW Jurgen went very often to court, since the
boy at twenty-one was fathoms deep in love
with Count Manuel’s second daughter, whom
they called Dorothy la Désirée. Coth saw her but
once: and, even over and above his rage at the thought
of sharing Jurgen with anybody, Coth was honestly
moved, in the light of his considerable boudoir experience,
to uncivil prophecy. He was upon this occasion,
in the main hall at Bellegarde, with dozens of
persons within earshot, most embarrassingly explicit
with Jurgen, alike as to the quality of Jurgen’s intelligence
and the profession which Coth desired no daughter-in-law
of his to practice.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two quarreled. That nowadays was no novelty.
The difference was that into this quarrel Jurgen put all
his heart. So the insolent, overbearing, bulldozing
young scoundrel was packed off to serve under the
Vidame de Soyecourt: and before the year was out Coth
heard that this Dorothy la Désirée was married to
Guivric’s son Michael.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This Michael is but the first served at an entertainment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>preparing for the general public,” was Coth’s
epithalamium.</p>

<p class='c005'>And many rumors came back to Haut Belpaysage as
to Jurgen’s doings in Gâtinais, and, while they all
seemed harmless enough, not all were precisely what a
father would have elected to hear. Coth considered, for
example, that Jurgen had acted with imprudence in thus
hastily making Coth a grandfather with the assistance
of the third wife of the Vidame de Soyecourt. Husbands
had a sad way of being provoked by such offspring,
upon the wholly illogical ground that the provocation
was not mutual. Still, young people needed their
diversions, and husbands, to Coth’s experience, were
not a dangerous tribe. What really fretted a somewhat
aging Alderman, however, was that such stories reached
him casually, and that from Jurgen himself he heard
nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet other gossip came too from the court at Bellegarde
and Storisende, as to how Manuel’s oldest daughter,
Madame Melicent, was now betrothed to King
Theodoret, and how upon the eve of her marriage she
had disappeared out of Poictesme: and she was next
heard of as living in unchristian splendor far oversea,
as—if you elected to put it more gracefully than Coth
did,—the wife of Miramon Lluagor’s son and murderer,
Demetrios.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not?” said Coth. “Why should not snub-nosed
Miramon’s swarthy lad be having his wenches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>when convenient? Parricide is no bar to fornication.
They are sins committed with quite different weapons.
And, for the rest, all sons are intent to do what this
one has succeeded in doing. How, for that matter, did
Dom Manuel, that famous Redeemer of yours, deal with
his own father Oriander the Swimmer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>That, it was hastily explained to him by his wife
Azra, was but a part of the great Redeemer’s abnegation
and self-denial. That was the atonement, and the
immolation of his only beloved father, in order to expiate
the gross sins of Poictesme—</p>

<p class='c005'>“To expiate the sins of one person by killing another
person,” replied Coth, “is not an atonement. It is nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, but, it was furthermore explained, this atonement
was a great and holy mystery; and, as such, it
should be approached with reverence rather than mere
rationality. Yet this high mystery of the atonement
must undoubtedly symbolize the fact that, in order to
attain perfection, Manuel had put off the ties of his
flesh—</p>

<p class='c005'>To which Coth answered, staring moodily at his wife
Azra: “I saw that fight. He put off those ties of his
flesh, and Oriander’s head from his body, with such
pleasure as Manuel showed in no other combat. And
all sons are like him. Have we not a son? Why do you
keep pestering me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I only meant—”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“Stop contradicting me!” But very swiftly Coth
added, with a sort of gulp, “—my dear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For Coth was changing. He hunted no more, he
had closed up his bear-pit. He seemed to prefer to be
alone. Azra would very often find him huddled in his
chair, not doing anything, but merely thinking: and
then he would glare at her ferociously, without speaking;
and she would go away from him, without speaking,
because she also thought too frequently about their
son for her own comfort.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THEN Emmerick came of age, and Madame
Niafer’s rule was over, men said, because the
Count would be swayed in all things by his
cousin, the Bishop Ayrart of Montors, the same that
afterward was Pope.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The young church rat drives out the old one,” said
Coth. “Now limping Niafer must learn to do without
a night-light and to sleep without a halo on her pillow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Ayrart’s supremacy was not for long, and Holy
Holmendis remained about the court, after all, because,
at just this time, lean Holden the Brave appeared at
Storisende with a beautiful young gray-eyed stranger
whom he introduced as the widow of Elphànor, King
of Kings. People felt that for this Radegonde thus to
be surviving her husband by more than thirteen centuries
was a matter meritorious of explanation, but
neither she nor Holden offered any.</p>

<p class='c005'>The history of the love which had been between
Radegonde and Holden is related elsewhere<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c030'><sup>[2]</sup></a>: at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>time it remained untold. But now, at this love’s ending,
Radegonde found favor in the small greedy eyes
of Count Emmerick, and she married him, nor was
there ever at any season thereafter during the lifetime
of Radegonde a question as to what person, howsoever
flightily, ruled over Poictesme and Emmerick. And
Radegonde—after a very prettily worded but frank
proviso as to the divine right of princes, which rendered
them and their wives responsible to Heaven directly,
and to nobody else, as she felt sure dear Messire
Holmendis quite understood,—Radegonde thereafter
favored Holmendis and his wonder-working reforms,
among the appropriate class of people, because she considered
that his halo was distinctly decorative, and that
a practicing saint about the court lent it, as she phrased
the matter, an air.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Coth heard of these things; and he nodded his great
dome-shaped head complacently enough. “A tree may
be judged by its fruit. Now in England Dom Manuel’s
long-legged bastard by Queen Alianora has returned
his young wife to the nursery. He is to-day, they tell
me,—in the approved fashion of all sons,—junketing
about foreign courts with the Lord of Bulmer’s daughter.
He, in brief, while the Barons steal England from
him, is intent upon begetting his own bastards—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you also, my husband—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you stop deafening me with your talk about
irrelevant matters! In Philistia, Dom Manuel’s most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>precious bantling by Queen Freydis is working every
manner of pagan iniquity, and has brought about the
imprisonment, in infamous Antan, of his own mother,
after having lived with her for some while in incest—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nevertheless—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Azra, you have, as I tell you for your own good, a
sad habit, and a very ill-bred habit also, of interrupting
people, and that habit is quite insufferable. A tree, I
repeat to you, may be judged by its fruit! Everybody
knows that. Now, in our Poictesme, the increase of
Dom Manuel’s body has, thus far, produced two
strumpets and a guzzling cuckold—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, even so—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are talking nonsense. A tree, I say to you,
may be judged by its fruit! I consider this exhibit
very eloquently convincing as to the true nature of our
Redeemer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Azra now answered nothing. And Coth fell to looking
at his motto, rather gloomily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was not that I meant,” he said, heroically, by and
by, “to be rude, my dear. But I do hate a fool, and,
in particular, an obstinate fool.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here too it must be recorded that upon the night of
Radegonde’s marriage old Holden had the ill taste to die.
That it was by his own hand, nobody questioned, but
the affair was hushed up: and Count Emmerick’s married
life thus started with gratifyingly less scandal than
it culminated in.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Coth heard of this thing also. He looked at his
motto, he recalled the love which he had borne for
Holden in the times when Coth had not yet given over
loving anybody: and he mildly wondered that Holden,
at his age, should still be clinging to the fallacy that
one wench was much more desirable than another. By
and large, thought Coth, they had but one use, for
which any one of them would serve, if you still cared
for such kickshaws. For himself, he was growing
abstemious; and as often as not, found it rather a nuisance
when any of his vassals married, and the Alderman
of St. Didol was expected to do his seignorial duty
by the new made wife. Things everywhere were dwindling
and deteriorating.</p>

<p class='c005'>Even the great Fellowship of the Silver Stallion was
wearing away, thus steadily, under the malice and greed
of time. Donander of Évre was to-day the only one of
Manuel’s barons who yet rode about the world, now
and then, in search of good fighting and fine women.
All the best of the fellowship were gone from life: the
hypocrites and the fools alone remained, Coth estimated
modestly. For he and that boy Donander were, at least,
not hypocrites....</p>

<p class='c005'>And very often, too, Coth would look at his wife
Azra, and would remember the girl that she had been
in the times when Coth had not yet given over loving
anybody. He rather liked her now. It was a felt
loss that she no longer had the spirit to quarrel with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>anything like the fervor of their happier days: not for
two years or more had Azra flung a really rousing taunt
or even a dinner plate in his direction: and Coth pitied
the poor woman’s folly in for an instant bothering about
that young scoundrel of a Jurgen, who had set up as a
poet, they said, and—in the company, one heard, of a
grand duchess,—was rampaging everywhither about
Italy, with never a word for his parents. Coth, now,
did not worry over such ingratitude at all: not less
than twenty times a day he pointed out to his wife that
he, for one, never wasted a thought upon the lecherous
runagate.</p>

<p class='c005'>His wife would smile at him, sadly: and after old
Coth had been particularly abusive of Jurgen, she would,
without speaking, stroke her husband’s knotted, stubby,
splotched hand, or his tense and just not withdrawing
cheek, or she would tender one or another utterly uncalled-for
caress, quite as though this illogical and broken-spirited
creature thought Coth to be in some sort of
trouble. The woman, though, had never understood
him....</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Azra died. Coth was thus left alone. It
seemed to him a strange thing that the Coth who had
once been a fearless champion and a crowned emperor
and a contender upon equal terms with the High Gods,
should be locked up in this quiet room, weeping like a
small, punished, frightened child.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>
  <h2 class='c028'><i>33.</i><br /><i>Economics of Coth</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>IN the months that followed, Coth wore a puzzled
and baffled look. His servants reported that he
talked to himself almost incessantly. But it was
incoherent, uncharacteristic stuff, without any quarreling
in it, they said.... Coth at the last had well-nigh
given over fault-finding. He was merely puzzled.</p>

<p class='c005'>For life, somehow, in some as yet undetected fashion,
seemed to have cheated him. It was not possible that,
with fair play everywhere, life would be affording you,
as the sum and harvest of all, no more than this. No
sort of pleasure remained: girls left, and for that matter
found, you wholly frigid; wine set you to vomiting.
You wanted, as if in a cold cemetery of desires, one
thing alone, nowadays.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet the son Jurgen whom Coth’s tough heart remembered
and desired was still frolicking about the
pleasant and famous places of the world, with no time
to waste in sedate Poictesme: and Coth rather suspected
that, even now, in this sick unimaginable loneliness,
were Jurgen to return, a feebly raging Coth
would storm at the lad and turn him out of doors.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>For that was Coth’s way. He had only one way....
He reflected, now, Jurgen was no longer a lad: it well
might be, indeed, that pock-marked, greasy-headed
roisterer had ended living, with some husband’s dagger
in his ribs. The last news heard of Jurgen, though, was
that he was making songs in Byzantium with the aid of
a runaway abbess, who at least had no husband. And
in any event, Jurgen would not ever return, because Coth
had come between the boy that had been and the leering,
high-nosed strumpet at Asch, who was reported to be
rivaling even that poor Kerin’s widow, Saraïde, in the
great number of her co-partners in lectual exercise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A pert pirate in all men’s affairs, a mere cockboat
sailing under the Jolly Roger!” was Coth’s verdict, as
repeated by an eavesdropping page. “This Madame
Dorothy has had in her more”—he mumbled so that
something was lost—“than there are trees in Acaire.
All the trees in Acaire are judged by their fruits. This
Dorothy is a very betraying fruit from the rank tree
of the Redeemer. This Dorothy has inherited from
Dom Manuel such lewdness as is advantageously suited
to a warrior, but misbecomes a young woman. It
seems rather a pity that this light wagtail should ever
have come between me and Jurgen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth said this without any raging. He was merely
puzzled.</p>

<p class='c005'>For all, everywhere, appeared to have failed and deserted
him. This Coth had been in his day a hero: and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>none of that far-off adventuring seemed much to matter
now, nor could he quite believe that these things
had happened to the tired old fellow who went muttering
about the lonely Château des Roches, and was kept
alive with slops of gruel and barley-water. This tremulous
frail wreckage was not, assuredly, the Coth who
had killed single-handed the three Turks at Lacre Kai,
and who had kidnapped the fat King of Cyprus and in
the sight of two armies had hung the crown of yet another
king on the thorn-bush at Piaja, and who had
been himself an emperor, and who had held the White
Tower at Skeaf against the Comprachos, and who had
put that remarkable deception upon the enamored one-legged
tyrant of Ran Reigan, and who had shared in so
many other splendid rough-and-tumble happenings.</p>

<p class='c005'>There had been a host of women in these happenings,
fine women, not to be had at anybody’s whistle like the
tow-headed Dorothys whom these sanctimonious times
were spawning everywhere to come between a father
and a boy with no real harm in him. And none of
these dear women mattered now.... Besides, it was
not true to say that Jurgen had no real harm in him.
Jurgen had been violent and headstrong from the very
first: that was another pity, but Jurgen had taken after
his mother in this, old Coth reflected, and his mother
had always been injudicious alike in pampering and in
rebuking Jurgen, with the result that Jurgen was nowadays
a compendium of all iniquity.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>And the Manuel too whom Coth had loved was gone
now, and was utterly ousted from every person’s memory
by that glittering tomb at Storisende, where a
Manuel who had never lived was adored as a god is
worshiped. Yet that, also, seemed not to matter. It
was preposterous. But all the world was preposterous:
and nothing whatever could be done about it, by a
tired muttering old man.</p>

<p class='c005'>People, no doubt, were living more quietly and more
decorously because of this fictitious Manuel whom they
loved and this gaunt ranting Holmendis whom they
feared. But that too, to Coth, seemed not to matter.
People nowadays were such fools that their doings and
the upshot of these doings were equally unimportant,
Coth estimated. If they succeeded in worming their
way into heaven by existing here as spiritlessly as
worms, Coth had not any objection, since he himself
was bound for hell and for the company of his peers
in a more high-hearted style of living.</p>

<p class='c005'>Coth fell a little complacently to thinking about hell,
and about the fine great sinners who would make room
for him there, on account of the Coth that had been, and
about the genial flames in which nobody was pestered
by milksops prattling about their damned Redeemer.
And Manuel—the real Manuel, that squinting swaggering
gray rogue whose thefts and bastards and killings
had been innumerous,—that Manuel would be there too,
of course; and he and Coth would make very excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>mirth over those reforms which had ensnared all the
milksops into heaven, even at the high price of spoiling
the Poictesme of Coth’s youth.</p>

<p class='c005'>For those elder heroic days were quite over. Of the
great fellowship there remained, beside the hulk that
was Coth, only Guivric and Donander and Ninzian.
Donader of Évre was now, they said, in the far kingdom
of Marabon, combining the pleasures of knight-errantry
with a pious pilgrimage to the tomb of St.
Thomas. And while Coth had always admired Donander
as a fighting-machine, in all other respects Coth
considered him a deplorable young fool, nor, after holding
this opinion steadfastly for twenty-five years, was
Coth prepared to change it. Ninzian was a sleek hypocrite,
a half-hearted fellow who had stinted himself to
one poor pale adultery with a pawnbroker’s wife; and
who flourished in the sanctimonious atmosphere of
these abominable times because he truckled to Holmendis
nowadays just as formerly he had toadied to
Manuel. That prim and wary Guivric, whom people
called the Sage, Coth had always most cordially detested:
and when Coth heard—from somebody, as he
cloudily remembered, but it was too much trouble to
recall from whom,—that old Guivric too was now departed
from Poictesme, it seemed not to matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps, Coth speculated, one of those troubled-looking
servants had told him Guivric was dead. Almost
everybody was dead. And in any event, it did not matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>about Guivric. Nothing really mattered any
longer....</p>

<p class='c005'>All that Coth had ever loved was gone out of life.
Gray Manuel, the most superb and admirable of earthly
lords (howsoever often the man had needed a little
candid talking to, for his own good), and peevish
tender-hearted wise Miramon, and courteous Anavalt,
and pedantic innocent Kerin (who had been used to
blink at you once or twice, like the most amiable of
owls, before he gave his opinion upon any subject),
and Holden, the most brave where all were fearless,
and indolent gay Gonfal, whom you might even permit,
within limits, to rally you, because Gonfal was the
world’s playmate,—all these were gone, the dearest of
comrades that any warrior had ever known, in that
lost, far-off season when the Fellowship of the Silver
Stallion had kept earth noisy with the clashing of their
swords, and had darkened heaven with the smoke of the
towns they were sacking, and when throughout the
known world men had talked about the wonders which
these champions were performing with Dom Manuel to
lead them.</p>

<p class='c005'>And so many splendid women too were gone: these
days produced only your flibbertigibbet Melicents and
Dorothys and such trash. There were no women nowadays
like Azra, nor like Gunnhilda, nor like Muirnê
of the Marshes,—or like plump, ardent, brown Utsumé,
or like Orgeleuse, that proud lady of Cyprus, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>yet yielded in the end, or like Azra.... And Coth,
chewing meditatively at nothingness, with sunken and
toothless lips, thought also about great-hearted Dame
Abonde, and about little Fleurette, and about Azra, and
about Credhê, that jolly if remarkably exigent Irish
girl, and about tall Asgerda, and about Azra, and about
Bar, that treacherous but very lovely sea-wife, and about
Oriande, and about poor Felfel Rhasif Yedua, who had
given all the hair of her body and afterward her life, to
preserve his life, and about Azra.</p>

<p class='c005'>He remembered the girl that Azra had been, and he
thought without any joy about the scores of other
delectable persons which Coth had known, amorously
and intricately, so very long ago. All these women were
gone out of living: one or two of them might perhaps
as yet pretend to survive in the repulsive skins of
shriveled old lean ugly hags, and in some remote
chimney-corner or another might as yet be mumbling—with
sunken and toothless lips, like his own lips,—over
nothingness; for nothingness was now their portion
too; and those close-kissing, splendid, satiated, half-swooning
girls whom Coth remembered, with indelicate
precision, now no longer existed anywhere.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Jurgen, the unparalleled of babies, and that
cuddling little lad prattling his childish lies about Dom
Manuel and ascents into heaven and other nonsense
to ward off a spanking, and that fine upstanding boy
just graduating into pimples in whom Coth had so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>exulted when Coth returned from Tollan and the throne
of Tollan,—his Jurgen in dozens upon dozens of stages
of growth,—now every one of these dear sons was
gone. There remained only a dissolute and heartless
wastrel bellowing rhymed nonsense and rampaging
about the world wherever the grand duchesses and the
abbesses made most of him. Coth looked at his motto.</p>

<p class='c005'>Life then, at utmost, after all the prizes of life had
been gained, and you were a looked-up-to and prosperous
alderman, amounted to just this. It profited nothing
that you had been a tender and considerate father, or a
dutiful and long-suffering son who had boxed your
father’s jaws, when you last parted from him, only after
considerable provocation,—or a loving and faithful husband
to the full extent of human frailty, or a fearless
champion killing off brawny adversaries like flies, or
even an emperor crowned with that queer soft gold of
Tollan and dragging black corrupted gods about the
public highways. In the end you were, none the less,
a withered hulk, with no more of pride nor any hope
of pleasure nor any real desire alive in you; and you
felt cold always, even while you nodded here beside the
fire; and there was not anybody to talk to, except those
perturbed-looking servants who never came very near
you....</p>

<p class='c005'>If you had only had a son, now, matters might be
different.... Then Coth recollected that he did, in
point of fact, have a son, somewhere. It had slipped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>his mind for the instant. But old people forget things,
and he was very old. Yes, a fine lad, that: and he
would be coming in for supper presently—extremely
late for supper, with his hat shoved a great way back
on his black head, and with his boots all muddy,—and
Azra would scold him.... Only, it seemed to Coth
that Azra, or somebody, was dead. That was a pity,
but it was too much trouble to remember all the pity
and the dying that was in the world; it was a great deal
too much trouble for an old man to keep these wearying
matters quite straight in his mind. And, besides, everybody
died; there was for all an end of all adventuring:
and nothing whatever could be done about it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, but at least one more adventure was yet to
come, for the Coth who could make no wheedling compromise
with the fictions by which fools live and preserve
alike their foolish hopes and their smirking amenities.
He had, he felt, been sometimes rather brusque
with these fools. But all that was over, too. They
went their way; and he was going his. And, once that
last adventure had been achieved, you might hope to
settle down comfortably with the swaggering and great-hearted
sinners, and to be stationed not too far from
that gray squinting sinner who had been the most dear
and admirable of earthly lords; and to foregather with
all such fine rogues eternally among the genial and robustious
flames, in which there was no more loneliness
and no more cold and no more pettifogging talk about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>some Redeemer or another paying your scot, and where
no more frightened servants would be spying on you
always....</p>

<p class='c005'>The adventure came unheralded, for Coth died in his
sleep, having outlived the wife of his youth by just four
months.</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>34.</i><br /><i>Something Goes Wrong: and Why</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the tale is of Guivric of Perdigon, more
generally called the Sage, who in the days
after Anavalt went into Elfhame was chief of
the lords of the Silver Stallion who yet remained in
Poictesme. And the tale tells how it appeared to Guivric
of Perdigon that something was going wrong.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had not anything tangible to complain of. There
was, indeed, no baron in Poictesme more powerful and
honored than was Guivric the Sage. He had no need
to bother over any notions about Manuel which in no
way affected the welfare of Guivric of Perdigon, and
he had no quarrel with the more staid and religious
ordering of matters which now prevailed in Poictesme.
Guivric had, howsoever frostily, adapted himself to
these times, and in them a reasonably staid and religious
Guivric had, thus, thrived.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Heitman of Asch, he still held as rigorously as
he had held in Manuel’s heyday, the fertile Piemontais
between the Duardenez river and Perdigon. He had
money and two castles, he lived in comeliness and splendor,
he had wisdom and a high name and the finest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>vineyards anywhere in those regions. He had every
reason to be proud of his tall prospering son Michael,
a depressingly worthy young warrior, whose superabundant
virtues, modeled with so much earnestness
after the Manuel of the legend, caused Guivric to regard
the amours of Michael’s wife (and Manuel’s daughter)
with quiet and unregenerate amusement. And Guivric
got on with his own wife as well, he flattered himself,
as any person could hope to do upon the more animated
side of deafness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet something, this prim and wary Guivric knew, was
somewhere going wrong. Things, even such prosaic
common things as the chair he was seated in, or his
own hands moving before him, were becoming dubious
and remote. People spoke with thinner voices: and
their bodies flickered now and then, as if these bodies
were only appearances of colored vapor. The trees of
Guivric’s flourishing woodlands would sometimes
stretch and flatten in the wind like trails of smoke. The
walls of Guivric’s fine home at Asch, and of his great
fort at Perdigon also, were acquiring, as their conservative
owner somewhat frettedly observed, a habit
of moving, just by a thread’s width, when you were
not quite looking at them; and of shifting in outline
and in station as secretively as a cloud alters.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instability and change lurked everywhere. Without
any warning well-known faces disappeared from Guivric’s
stately household: the men-at-arms and the lackeys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>who remained seemed not to miss them, nor indeed ever
to have known of those vanished associates.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Guivric found that the saga which the best-thought-of
local bards had compiled and adorned, under
his supervision, so as to preserve for posterity’s benefit
the glorious exploits and the edifying rewards of
Guivric the Sage, was dwindling alike in length and in
impressiveness. Overnight a line here and there, or a
whole paragraph, would drop out unaccountably, an
adventure would lose color, or an achievement would
become less clear-cut: and the high and outrageous
doings in which Guivric had shared as a lord of the
Silver Stallion, these began, in particular, to become
almost unrecognizable. At this rate, people would
soon have no assurance whatever that Guivric the
Sage had lived in unexampled heroism and respectability
and had most marvelously prospered in everything.</p>

<p class='c005'>And it was all quite annoying. It was as though
Guivric, or else each one of his possessions and human
ties, were wasting away into a phantom: and neither
alternative seemed pleasant to consider.</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric locked fast the doors of the brown room in
which now for so many years he had conducted his
studies and his thaumaturgies. He set out a table,
the top of which was inscribed with three alphabets.
He put on a robe of white: about his withered neck he
arranged a garland of purple vervain such as is called
herb-of-the-cross. From seven rings he selected—because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>this day was a Sunday,—the gold ring inset
with a chrysolite upon which was engraved the figure
of a lion-headed serpent.</p>

<p class='c005'>When this ring had been hung above the table, with
a looped red hair plucked long ago from the tail of a
virgin nightmare, and when the wan Lady of Crossroads
had been duly invoked, then Guivric lighted a
taper molded from the fat of Saracen women and of
unweaned dogs, and with the evil flaming of this taper
he set fire to the looped hair. The red hair burned with
a small spiteful sizzling: the gold ring fell. The ring
rolled about upon the table, it uncoiled, it writhed, it
moved glitteringly among the characters of three alphabets,
passing like a tortured worm from one ideograph
to another, and it revealed to Guivric the dreadful
truth.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Sylan whom people called Glaum-Without-Bones
was at odds with Guivric. This was not a matter
which anybody blessed with intelligent self-interest
could afford to neglect.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>
  <h2 class='c028'><i>35.</i><br /><i>Guivric’s Journey</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>CERTAINLY Guivric the Sage, who cared only
for himself, did not neglect this matter. The
prim and wary man armed, and rode eastward,
beyond Megaris; and fared steadily ever further into
the East, traveling beyond the Country of Widows
and the fearful Isle of the Ten Carpenters. Then, at
Oskander’s Well, Guivric put off material armor. He
put off even his helmet, and in its stead he assumed a
cap of owl feathers. He passed through arid high
pastures, beyond the wall of the Sassanid, he rubbed
lemon juice upon his horse’s legs and rode unmolested
through the broad and shallow lake, and thus came to
the Sylan’s House. And all went well enough at
first.</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric had feared, for one thing, that the Norns
would forbid his entering into the mischancy place:
but when he had tethered safely the fine horse which
Guivric was never again to ride upon, he found that
the gray weavers did not hinder him. They had not
ever, they said, planned any future for Guivric: and it
was all one to them whether he fared forward to face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>his own destruction or intrepidly went back to living
with his wife.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But do you not weave the sagas and the dooms of
all men?” he asked of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not yours,” lean Skuld replied, looking up at him
with pallid little cold bright eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric thus passed the haggard daughters of Dvalinn;
and the proud man went onward, disquieted but
unhindered. And in the gray anteroom beyond, were
the progenitors of Guivric disporting themselves, each
in the quaint manner of his bygone day, and talking
with uneager and faded voices about the old times.</p>

<p class='c005'>Since none of these ancestors had ever heard or
thought of Guivric, they gave scant attention to him
now. And to see them was upsetting, somehow. One
of these strangers had Guivric’s high thin nose, and
another just his long thin hands, and another his prim
mouth, and another his excellent broad shoulders.
Guivric could recognise all these fragments of himself
moving at random about the gray room. He knew that, less
visibly but quite as really, his tastes and his innate
aversions—his little talents and failings and out-of-date
loyalties, his quickness at figures, his aptitude for
drawing, his tendency to catch cold easily, and his
liking for sweets and highly seasoned foods,—were
all passing about this gray room.</p>

<p class='c005'>A compost of odds and ends had been patched
together from these unheeding persons; that almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>accidental patchwork was Guivric: the thought was
humiliating. There was, he reflected, in this gray
room another complete Guivric, only this other Guivric
was not entire, but moved about in scattered fragments.
That thought, appeared to a peculiarly self-centered
person like Guivric, rather uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c005'>So Guivric went beyond his ancestors. Without
delay the proud man passed stiffly by the inconsiderate
people whose casual amours had created him, and had
given him life and all his qualities, without consulting
his preference or his convenience, or even thinking
about him.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>
  <h2 class='c028'><i>36.</i><br /><i>The Appointed Enemy</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>HE came to a door beside which a saturnine castrato
sat drowsing over a scythe. Guivric
caught him intrepidly by the forelock; and
tugging at it, thus forced the gaunt warden in his pain
to cry out, “Enough!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For time enough is little enough,” said Guivric,
“and when you are little enough, I can go safely by
without killing time here. And that I shall certainly
do, because to spare time is to lengthen life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, come now,” grumbled the ancient warden,
“but these tonsorial freedoms and this foolish talking
seem very odd—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Time,” Guivric answered him, “at last sets all
things even.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Guivric walked widdershins in a complete
circle about the old eunuch; and so went on into a room
hung with black and silver: and in this place was a
young and beautifully fashioned boy, with the bright
unchanging gaze of a serpent.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boy arose; and, putting aside a rod upon which
grew black poppies, each with a silver-colored heart, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>said to Guivric, “It is needful that you should hate.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, at the sight of this stranger, Guivric was filled
with an inexplicable wild rapture; and after shaping
the sign of the River Horse and of the Writing of Lo,
he demanded of this young man his name.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the other only answered: “I am your appointed
enemy. There is between us an eternal hatred; and
should our bodies encounter we would contend as
heroes. But something has gone wrong, our sagas
have been perverted, and our spirits have been ensnared
into the Sylan’s House, and all our living wears
thin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, come, my enemy!” cried Guivric, “hatred—since,
as you tell me, this is hatred,—is throbbing in
me now as a drum beats: and I would that we two
might encounter!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That may not be,” replied the young man. “I
am only a phantom in the Sylan’s House. I live as a
newborn child in Denmark, I drowse as yet in swaddling
cloths, dreaming at this instant about my appointed
enemy. Yet in the life which you now have
you will not ever go to Denmark: and by the time that
I am grown, and am able to wield a sword and to contrive
mischief against you, and to beset you everywhere
with my lewd perversities, the body which you now have
will have been taken away from you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sorry,” Guivric said, “for in all my life, even
in the rough old times of that blundering Manuel— I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>mean, of course, that, although I was privileged to
share in the earthly labors of the Redeemer, in all my
life I have never hated before to-day. I have merely
disliked some persons, somewhat as I dislike cold veal
or house-flies, without real ardor. And very often these
persons could be useful to me, so that, through many
little flatteries and small falsehoods, I must keep on
their good side. But I perceive now that, throughout
the living which my neighbors applaud and envy, I have
needed some tonic adversary to exalt my living with
a great and heroic loathing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know, dear adversary! And I know too that all
the life which I now have must run slack because of
an unfed lusting for my appointed enemy. But affairs
will go more grandly by and by, if ever we get out of
the Sylan’s House.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Heyday,” said Guivric, masterfully, “I am not going
out! Instead, I am going in, even to the heart of this
mischancy place; and you must go with me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But the lad shook his lovely evil head. “No: for,
now that the Sylan is about to become human, they
tell me, at the heart of the Sylan’s House is to be found
pity and terror; and both of these must remain forever
unknown to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, but why?” said Guivric, “why need those
two cathartics which Aristotle most highly recommends
remain forever unknown to you in particular?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah,” replied the boy, “that is a mystery. I only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>know it is decreed—and is decreed, for that matter, in
the name of Eloim, Muthraton, Adonay, and Semiphoras,—that
my rod here as it was first raised up in
Gomorrah should possess quite other virtues than the
rods of Moses and of Jacob.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, in Gomorrah! So it was in that wicked city
of the plain of Jordan, my spoiled child, that they
first spared the rod! I see. For is not that rod to be
used—thus?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Guivric showed with a discreet but obvious
gesture what he meant.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lad fearlessly answered him.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c008' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>
  <h2 class='c028'><i>37.</i><br /><i>Too Many Mouths</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>SO Guivric quitted his appointed enemy. And at
the next door sat a discomfortable looking dyspeptic,
crowned and wearing an old shroud, and
huddled up, as if by spasms of pain, upon a tombstone,
very neatly engraved with the arms and the
name and the parentage and the titles of Guivric of
Perdigon. Only the date and the manner of Guivric’s
decease remained as yet vacant. And the crowned toiler
put aside his chisel, and he grinned at Guivric rather
pitiably.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I really must be more careful,” observed this second
warden, groaning and fidgeting and shaking his
fleshless head, but of necessity grinning all the while,
because he had no lips. “I am decreed, you see, to keep
no measure in my diet; I must eat sheep as well as
lambs; and afterward I find out only too plainly that
there is not any medicine for death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric, without a word of condolence, took out of
his pocket a handful of coins, and he selected from
among the thalers and pistoles a newly minted mark.
This coin he tendered to the second warden, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>tomb-maker accepted lovingly this shining mark. Then
Guivric walked widdershins in a circle about this warden
also: and when the king of terrors had been thus circumvented,
Guivric went forward into the next room. A
sweet and piercing and heavy odor now went with
Guivric, and clung to him, and it was like the odor of
embalming spices.</p>

<p class='c005'>This room was hung with white and gold; and in
this room a plump and naked man, wearing only a miter,
was praying to nine gods. He arose and, after brushing
off his reddened knees, he said to Guivric, “It is
needful that you should believe.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish to believe,” replied Guivric. “Yet when I
ask— Well, but you know what always happens.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such, my dear errant son, is the accustomed punishment
of unhallowed curiosity. It should, equally, be
looked for and overlooked. The important thing is to
believe.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric smiled rather bleakly now, beneath his cap
of owl feathers. He said, like one who repeats a
familiar ritual, “What should I believe?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Upon the arms and upon the chest and upon the belly,
and everywhere upon the naked body of the mitered
man, opened red and precise-looking mouths, and each
mouth answered Guivric’s question differently, and in
the while that they all spoke together no one of these
answers was clear. The utmost which Guivric could
distinguish in the confusion was some piping babblement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>about Manuel the Redeemer. Then the mouths
ended their speaking, and closed, and became invisible.
The mitered man now seemed like any other benevolent
gentleman in the middle years of a well-fed existence,
and he was no longer horrible.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You see,” said Guivric, with a shrug. “You see
what always happens. I ask, and I am answered. Afterward
I am impressed by the unusual phenomena, and
I am slightly nauseated: but I, none the less, do not
know which one of your countless mouths I should put
faith in, and so bribe it to smile at me and prophesy
good things.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That does not matter at all, my son. You have but
to believe in whatsoever divine revealment you prefer
as to what especial Redeemer will come to-morrow, and
then you will live strongly and happily, you will go no
longer as a phantom in the Sylan’s House.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Heyday!” said Guivric, “but it is you who are the
phantom, and not I!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The other for a moment was silent. Then he too
shrugged. “With secular opinions as to such unimportant
and wholly personal matters no belief is concerned.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I,” Guivric pointed out, “do not think this an unimportant
matter. At all events, each one of your
mouths speaks to me with the same authority and resonance:
and in consequence, I can hear none of them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, well!” said the plump mitered man, resignedly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“that sometimes happens, they tell me, when the Sylan
is at odds with anybody. But, for one, I keep away
from the Sylan, now that the Sylan is about to become
human, because I suspect that at the heart of the Sylan’s
House abides that which is too pitiable and too terrible
for any of my mouths to aid.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know about your aiding such things or
any other things,” replied Guivric. “But I do know
that, even though you dare not accompany me, I intend
to match my thaumaturgies against the Sylan’s magic;
and that we shall very shortly see what comes of it.”</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>38.</i><br /><i>The Appointed Lover</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW at the next door sat a fierce and jealous
destroyer, with a waned glory about his venerable
Semitic head. The upper half of him
was like amber, his lower parts shone as if with a fading
fire. He seemed forlorn and unspeakably outworn.
He looked without love at Guivric, saying, “<span class='sc'>Ahih
Ashr Ahih</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No deity could put it fairer than that, sir,” replied
Guivric. “I respect the circumstance. Nevertheless, I
have made a note of your number, and it is five hundred
and forty-three.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then about this warden also Guivric walked widdershins,
in a complete circle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Issachar is a large-limbed ass,” said Guivric, soberly.
“He has become a servant under taskwork. Yet his
is the circumambulation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Whereafter Guivric still went onward, into the next
room: and Guivric’s feet now glittered each with a
pallid halo, for in that instant he had trodden very
near to God, and glory clung to them.</p>

<p class='c005'>And in this room, which was hung with green and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>rose-color, white pigeons were walking about and eating
barley. In the midst of the room a woman was
burning violets and white rose-petals and olive wood
in a new earthen dish. She arose from this employment,
smiling. And her loveliness was not a matter of
mere color and shaping, such as may be found elsewhere
in material things: rather, was this loveliness
a light which lived and was kindly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now this dear woman too began, “It is needful—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think it is not at all needful, madame, to explain
what human faculty you would exhort me to exercise.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric said this with a gallant frivolity: and yet he
was trembling.</p>

<p class='c005'>And after a while of looking at him somewhat sadly,
the woman asked, “Do you not, then, remember me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a strange thing, madame,” he answered, “it
is a very strange thing that I should so poignantly remember
you whom I have not ever seen before to-day.
For I am shaken by old and terrible memories, I am
troubled by the greatness of ancient losses not ever to
be atoned for, in the exact moment that I cannot, for
the life of me, say what these memories and these
losses are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have loved me,—not once, but many times, my
appointed lover.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have loved a number of women, madame,—although
I have of course avoided giving rise to any
regrettable scandal. And it has been very pleasant to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>love women without annoying the prejudices of their
recognized and legitimate proprietors. It enables one
to combine physical with mental exercise. But this is
not pleasant. To the contrary, I am frightened. I am
become as a straw in a wide and rapid river: I am indulging
in no pastime: that which is stronger than I can
imagine is hurrying me toward that of which I am ignorant.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know,” she answered. “Time upon time it has
been so with us. But something has gone wrong—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What has happened, madame, is that the Sylan is at
odds with me; and covets, so my dactyliomancy informed
me, some one thing or it may be two things
which I possess.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Sylan is about to become human. That is why
your saga has been perverted, and that is the reason
of your having been ensnared as a phantom into the
Sylan’s House—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Eh, then, and do you also, madame, dismiss me as
a phantom!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, but of course no person’s body may enter into
this mischancy place! The body which I have to-day,
my appointed lover, is that of a very old woman in
Cataia, nodding among my body’s many children and
grandchildren, and dreaming of the love this life has
denied to me. It is a blotched and shriveled body,
colored like a rotting apple: and the bodies which we
now have may not ever encounter. So all our living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>wears thin, and the lives that we now have must both
be wasted tepidly, as a lukewarm water is poured out:
and there is now no help for it, now that the Sylan
is at odds with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I go to match my thaumaturgies against his magic,”
said Guivric stoutly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You go, my dearest, to face that thing which is
most pitiable and terrible of all things that be! You go
to face your own destruction!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nevertheless,” said Guivric, “I go.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet still he looked at this woman. And Guivric’s
thin hard lips moved restively. He sighed. He turned
away and went on silently. His face could not be seen
under his cap of owl feathers, but his broad shoulders
sagged a little.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>BESIDE the next door lay a huge white stallion.
And as Guivric approached this door, it opened.
Through the brown curtains came that ambiguous
young man called Horvendile, with whom Guivric,
off and on, had held considerable traffic during a forty
years’ practice of thaumaturgies.</p>

<p class='c005'>The stallion now arose, before Guivric could walk
widdershins about him, and the stallion went statelily
away. And Horvendile gazed after the superb beast,
rather wistfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He, too,” said Horvendile, “goes as a phantom
here. Is it not a pity, Guivric, that this Kalki will not
come in our day, and that we shall not ever behold his
complete glory? I cry a lament for that Kalki who
will some day bring back to their appointed places high
faith and very ardent loves and hatreds; and who will
see to it that human passions are never in a poor way
to find expression with adequate speech and action.
Ohé, I cry a loud lament for Kalki! The little silver
effigies which his postulants fashion and adore are well
enough: but Kalki is a horse of another color.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“I did not come into this accursed place to talk about
horses and nightmares,” replied Guivric, “but to attend
to the righting of the wrongs contrived by one
Glaum-Without-Bones, who is at odds with me, and
who has perverted my saga.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Horvendile reflected for an instant. He said,
“You have then, after so many years, come of your
own will into the East, just as I prophesied, to face the
most pitiable and terrible of all things?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric answered, guardedly, “I cannot permit my
saga to be perverted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Horvendile said then: “Nevertheless, I consider the
saga of no lord of the Silver Stallion to be worth squabbling
over. Your sagas in the end must all be perverted
and engulfed by the great legend about Manuel.
No matter how you may strive against that legend, it
will conquer: no matter what you may do and suffer,
my doomed Guivric, your saga will be recast until it
conforms in everything to the legend begotten by the
terrified imaginings of a lost child. For men dare not
face the universe with no better backing than their own
resources; all men that live, and that go perforce about
this world like blundering lost children whose rescuer
is not yet in sight, have a vital need to believe in this
sustaining legend about the Redeemer: and the wickedness
and the foolishness of no man can avail against
the foolishness and the fond optimism of mankind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“These aphorisms,” Guivric conceded, “may be judicious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>they may be valuable, they may even have some
kernel somewhere of rational meaning. But, in any
case, they do not justify my living’s having been upset
and generally meddled with by a lecherous and immodest
Sylan who goes about wearing not even a
skeleton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Horvendile replied: “I can see no flaw in your way
of living. You are the chief of Emmerick’s barons
now that Anavalt is gnawed bones in Elfhame: you
have wealth and rather more than as much power as
Emmerick himself, now that your son is Emmerick’s
brother-in-law, and poor Emmerick is married to a
widow. You are a well-thought-of thaumaturgist, and
you are, indeed, excelled in your art by nobody since
Miramon Lluagor’s death. And you have also, they
tell me, a high name for wisdom and for learning now
that Kerin has gone down under the earth. What
more can anybody ask?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ask for much more than for this sort of cautious
and secondary excellence.” Guivric seemed strangely
desperate. He spoke now, with a voice which was not
in anything prim and wary, saying, “I ask for the man
whom I can hate, for the priest whom I can believe,
and for the woman whom I can love!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Horvendile shook his red curls, and he smiled
a little cruelly. “Successful persons, my poor careful
Guivric, cannot afford to have any of these luxuries.
And one misses them. I know. The Sylan too is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>in his crude and naïve way, a successful person. He is
now almost human. He cherishes phantoms, therefore,
and I suspect these phantoms have been troubling
you with their nonsense, since it is well known that all
illusions haunt the corridors of this mischancy place
into which phantoms alone may enter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet I have entered it,” Guivric pointed out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” Horvendile said, non-committally.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I now enter,” Guivric stated, “to the heart of
it, to match my thaumaturgies against the Sylan’s
magic.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THEN Guivric passed through this door likewise;
and so, with glowing feet and with an odor
of funereal spices, Guivric came into the room
in which was the Sylan. Glaum-Without-Bones looked
up from his writing, tranquilly. Glaum said nothing:
he merely smiled. All was quiet.</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric noticed a strange thing, and it was that this
room was hung with brown and was furnished with
books and pictures which had a familiar seeming. And
then he saw that this room was in everything like the
brown room at Asch in which now for so many years
he had conducted his studies and his thaumaturgies;
and that in this mischancy place, for all his arduous
traveling beyond the Country of Widows and the fearful
Isle of the Ten Carpenters and the high Wall of the
Sassanid, here you still saw, through well-known windows,
the familiar country about Asch and the gleaming
of the Duardenez river, and beyond this the long plain
of Amneran and the tall Forest of Acaire. And Guivric
saw that this Glaum-Without-Bones, who sat there
smiling up at Guivric, from under a cap of owl feathers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>had in everything the appearance of the aging man who
had so long sat in this room; and that Glaum-Without-Bones
did not differ in anything from Guivric the
Sage.</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric spoke first. He said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is a strong magic. This is a sententious magic.
They had warned me that I would here face my own
destruction, that I would here face the most pitiable and
terrible of all things: and I face here that which I have
made of life, and life of me. I shudder; I am conscious
of every appropriate sentiment. Nevertheless,
sir, I must venture the suggestion that mere, explicit
allegory as a form of art is somewhat obsolete.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Glaum-Without-Bones replied: “What have I to do
with forms of art? My need was of a form of flesh and
blood. I had need of a human body and of human
ties and of a human saga of the Norn’s most ruthless
weaving. We Sylans have our powers and our privileges,
but we are not the children of any god; and so,
when we have lived out our permitted centuries, we
must perish utterly unless we can contrive to become
human. Therefore I had sore need of all human discomforts,
so that a soul might sprout in me under oppression
and chastening, and might, upon fair behavior,
be preserved in eternal bliss, and not ever perish as we
Sylans perish.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Everybody has heard of these familiar facts about
you Sylans,” returned Guivric, impatiently, “and it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>your stealing, in this shabby fashion, of my own particular
human ties that I consider unheard-of—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, yes,” said Glaum, with some complacence,
“that was done through a rare magic, and through a
strong magic, and through a magic against which there
is no remedy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That we shall see about! For what has happened
to me is not fair—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course it is not,” Glaum assented. “The doom
which is now upon you is no fairer than the doom
which was upon me yesterday, to perish utterly like a
weed or an old tom-cat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“—And so I have come hither to match my resistless
thaumaturgies against your piddling magic, and to
compel you to restore to me your pilferings—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall restore to you,” Glaum stated, “nothing.
And I have taken all. Your saga is now my saga,
your castles are my castles, your son is my son, and
your body is my body. Inside that body I intend to
live self-mortifyingly and virtuously, for some ten
years or so; and then that body will die: but by that
time a soul will have sprouted in me, an immortal soul
which, you may be certain, I shall keep stainless, because
I at least know how to appreciate such a remunerative
bit of property. Thus, when your tomb becomes
my tomb, that soul will of course ascend to eternal
bliss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what,” said Guivric, scornfully, “what if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>do not consent to be robbed of the salvation assured
to me by sixty years of careful and respectable living?
and what if I compel you—?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think that, in your sorry case, you should not speak
of compelling anybody to do anything. Nor is it altogether
my doing that your house is now the Sylan’s
House. Self-centered and self-righteous man, you had
no longer any strength nor real desires, but only many
little habits. Nothing at all solid remained really yours,
not even when I first set about my magicking. Oho,
and then you were an easy prey! and the human ties
you held so lightly slipped very lightly away from you
who had so long been living without any love or hatred
or belief. For throughout that over-comfortable while
the strength and the desire had been oozing out of you,
and all your living wore thin. I had only to complete
the emaciation. And in consequence”—Glaum gestured,
rather gracefully, with Guivric’s long thin hands,—“in
consequence, you go as a phantom.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric saw this was regrettably true. He saw it was
as a slight grayish mist, through which he was looking
down unhindered at the familiar rug behind him,
that he now wavered and undulated in the midst of this
room in which he had for so many years pursued his
studies without a hint of such levity. Yet nothing was
changed. Guivric of Perdigon still sat there, behind
the oak table with copper corners. Guivric of Perdigon
kept his accustomed place, palpable and prim and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>wary, as vigorous as could be hoped for at his age,
and honored and well-to-do, and, in fine, with nothing
left to ask for, as men estimate prosperity.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the living of this Guivric was reasonably assured
of going on like that, for year after year, quite
comfortably, and with people everywhere applauding,
and with nothing anywhere alluring you toward any
rash excesses in the way of emotion. It was from this
established and looked-up-to sort of living that a nefarious
Sylan was planning to oust Guivric the Sage;
and to leave Guivric a mere phantom, a thing as transitory
and as disreputable—and of course, in a manner of
speaking, as free too, and as lusty and as ageless,—as
the Sylan’s self had been only yesterday.... For
those abominable thieves and ravishers of maidens did
not grow old and vigorless and tired: instead, when the
appointed hour had struck, they vanished....</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, well!” said Guivric, and he now flickered into
a sitting posture, more companionably. “This sort of
eviction from every human tie is unexpected and high-handed
and deplorable and so on. But we ought, even
when all else is being lost, to retain composure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Sylan let him talk....</p>

<p class='c005'>And Guivric went on: “So, you are indissuadably resolved,
at the cost of any possible conflict between my
thaumaturgies and your magic, to leave me just a disembodied
intelligence! Do you know, Messire Glaum, I
cannot quite regard it as a compliment, that you refuse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>to take over my intelligence! Yet you, no doubt, prefer
your own intelligence—”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Sylan let him talk....</p>

<p class='c005'>But Guivric had paused. For the Sylan’s intelligence
had, after all, enabled Glaum to acquire—through
howsoever irregular methods,—the utmost that a reasonable
mind could look for in the way of success and
comfort and of future famousness long after Glaum-Without-Bones
had ascended to the eternal bliss assured
by a careful and respectable past. The Sylan’s
intelligence had gained for him the very best that any
man could hope for. There was thus no firm ground,
after all, upon which any human being could disrespect
the Sylan’s intelligence.... It was only that these
Sylans, always so regrettably lewd and spry, did not
ever grow old and tired and vigorless: they did not
ever, except of their own volition, become disgustingly
smug-looking old prigs: instead when the appointed
hour had struck, they vanished....</p>

<p class='c005'>“—For your intelligence appears to me a very terrible
sort of intelligence,” Guivric continued, “and I have
no doubt that your magic is upon a plane with it. My
little thaumaturgies could have no chance whatever
against such magic and such intelligence. Oh, dear me,
no! So I concede my helplessness, Messire Glaum,
without mounting the high and skittish horse of virtuous
indignation. I avoid the spectacle of an unseemly
wrangle between fellow artists: and, in asking you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>restore to me the customary rewards of a thrifty and
virtuous and in every way prosperous existence, I can
but appeal to your mercy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I,” said the Sylan, “have none.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I had hoped”—here Guivric coughed. “Anguish,
sheer anguish, sir, deprives me of proper control of
my tongue. For I had of course meant to say,” Guivric
continued, upon a more tragic note,—“so I had
hoped in vain! Now every hope is gone. Henceforward
you are human, and I am only an unhonored
vague Sylan! Well, it is all very terrible; but nothing
can be done about it, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing whatever can be done about it,—unless you
prefer to court something worse with those thaumaturgies
of yours?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Guivric was pained. “But, between fellow artists!”
he stated. “Oh, no, dear Glaum, that sort of open
ostentatious rivalry, for merely material gains, seems
always rather regrettably vulgar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, then, if you will pardon me,” the Sylan submitted,
in Guivric’s most civil manner when dealing
with unimportant persons, “I shall ask to be excused
from prolonging our highly enjoyable chat. Some other
time, perhaps— But I really am quite busy this morning:
and, besides, our wife will be coming in here any
minute, to call me to dinner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall not intrude.” Vaporously arising, Guivric
now smiled, with a new flavor of sympathy. “A rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>terrible woman, that, you will find! And, Lord, how
a young Guivric did adore her once! Nowadays she
is one of the innumerous reasons which lead me to
question if you have been quite happily inspired, even
with the delights of heaven impendent. You see, she
is certainly going to heaven. And Michael too,—do
you know, I think you will find Michael, also, something
of a bore? He expects so much of his father,
and when those expectations seem imperiled he does
look at you so exactly like a hurt, high-minded cow!
Now it is you who will have to live up to his notions,
and to the notions of that fond, fretful, foolish woman,
and it is you who will be bothered with an ever-present
sense of something lost and betrayed—! But you
will live up to their idiotic notions, none the less! And
I do not doubt that, just as you say, the oppression and
the chastening will be good for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Sylan answered, sternly, “Poor shallow learned
selfish fool! it is that love and pride, it is their faith and
their jealousy to hide away your shortcomings, it is the
things you feebly jeer at, which will create in me a
soul!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No doubt—” Then Guivric went on hastily, and in
a tone of cordial encouragement. “Oh, yes, my dear
fellow, there is not a doubt of it! and I am sure you
will find the birth-pangs well rewarded. Heaven, everybody
tells me, is a most charming place. Meanwhile,
if you do not mind, just for a minute, pray do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>contort my face so unbecomingly until after I am quite
gone! To see what right-thinking and a respectably
inflated impatience with frivolity can make of my face,
and has so often made of my face,” reflected Guivric,
as he luxuriously drifted out of the familiar window
like a smoke, “is even now a little humiliating. But,
then, the most salutary lessons are invariably the most
shocking.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THUS the true Guivric passed beyond the knowledge
of men: and the false Guivric gathered
up his papers and took off his cap of owl feathers
and prepared for dinner.</p>

<p class='c005'>The wife and the son of Guivric from that time
forth delighted in his affection and geniality: and it
was observed, for another wonder, that Guivric of
Perdigon had, with increasing age, graduated from a
cool reserve about religious matters into very active
beneficence and piety. The legend of Manuel had nowhere,
now, a more fervent adherent and expounder,
because Glaum nourished his sprouting soul with every
sort of religious fertilizer. Nor was his loving-kindness
confined to talking about itself, for the good works
of Glaum were untiring and remarkably free-handed,
since he had everything to gain by being liberal with
Guivric’s property.</p>

<p class='c005'>The old gentleman thus became a marked favorite
with Holy Holmendis: and indeed it was Glaum who
at this time, when Guivric’s ancient comrade Kerin of
Nointel came back into Poictesme, chiefly assisted Holmendis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span> in converting Kerin to the great legend of
Manuel.</p>

<p class='c005'>In fine, Glaum lived, without detection, in Guivric’s
body; and preserved it in unquestioned virtue, since
a well-to-do nobleman is, after sixty, subject to very
few temptations which cannot be gratified quietly without
scandal. He died in the assurance of a blessed
resurrection, which he no doubt attained.</p>

<p class='c005'>As for the true Guivric, nothing more was ever quite
definitely known of him. It was remarked, however,
that for many years thereafter an amorous devil went
invisibly about the hill country behind Perdigon. The
girls of Valnères and Ogde reported that by three traits
alone could the presence of this demon be detected:
for one thing, he diffused a sweet and poignant odor,
not unlike that of an embalmer’s spiceries; and, for
another, the soles of his feet had been observed, after
dusk, to be luminous. A third infallible sign of his
being anywhere near you they, with blushes and some
giggling, declined to reveal.</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the tale tells that it was in the winter after
Guivric’s encounter with the Sylan that Kerin
of Nointel returned into Poictesme to become
yet another convert to the great legend of Manuel;
and tells also of how for the first time men learned
why and in what fashion Kerin had gone out of Poictesme.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore the tale harks back to very ancient days, in
the May month which followed the passing of Manuel,
and the tale speaks of a season wherein it appeared to
Kerin of Nointel that he could understand his third
wife no better than he had done the others. But for
that perhaps unavoidable drawback to matrimony, he
was then living comfortably enough with this Saraïde,
whom many called a witch, in her ill-spoken-of, eight-sided
home beside the notorious dry Well of Ogde.
This home was gray, with a thatched roof upon which
grew abundant mosses and many small wild plants; a
pair of storks nested on the gable; and elder-trees
shaded all.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a very quiet and peaceful place, in which, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Kerin estimated, two persons might well have lived in
untroubled serenity, now that the Fellowship of the Silver
Stallion was disbanded, and a younger Kerin’s
glorious warfaring under Dom Manuel was done with
forever.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mild-mannered, blinking Kerin, for one, did not
regret Dom Manuel’s passing. The man had kept you
fighting always, whether it was with the Easterlings or
the Northmen, or with Othmar Black-Tooth or with
old yellow Sclaug or with Manuel’s father, blind Oriander.
It was a life which left you no time whatever
for the pursuit of any culture. Kerin liked fighting,
within moderation, with persons of admitted repute.
But Kerin, after four years of riding into all quarters
of the earth at the behest of this never-resting Manuel,
was heartily tired of killing strangers in whom Kerin
was in no way interested.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, upon the whole, it was a relief to be rid of
Manuel and to be able once more to marry, and to
settle down at Ogde in the eight-sided house under
the elder-trees. Yet, even in this lovely quietude, the
tale repeats, the third wife of Kerin seemed every night
to bother herself, and in consequence her husband,
about a great many incomprehensible matters.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now of the origin of Saraïde nothing can here be
told with profit and decorum: here it is enough to say
that an ambiguous parentage had provided this Saraïde
with a talisman by which you might know the truth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>when truth was found. And one of the many things
about Kerin’s wife which Kerin could not quite understand,
was her constant complaining that she had not
found out assuredly the truth about anything, and, in
particular, the truth as to Saraïde.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I exist,” she would observe to her husband, “and I
am in the main as other women. Therefore, this Saraïde
is very certainly a natural phenomenon. And in
nature everything appears to be intended for this, that
or the other purpose. Indeed, after howsoever hasty
consideration of the young woman known as Saraïde,
one inevitably deduces that so much of loveliness and
wit and aspiration, of color and perfume and tenderness,
was not put together haphazardly; and that the
compound was painstakingly designed to serve some
purpose or another purpose. It is about that purpose
I want knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Kerin would reply, “As you like, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So this young Saraïde, whom many called a witch,
had sought, night after night, for the desired knowledge,
in widely various surroundings, from the clergy, from
men of business, from poets, and from fiends; and
had wakened in her talisman every color save only
that golden shining which would proclaim her capture
of the truth. This clear soft yellow ray, as she explained
to Kerin, would have to be evoked, if ever, in
the night season, because by day its radiance might
pass unnoticed and her perception of the truth be lost.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Kerin could understand the common-sense of this,
at any rate. And so young Saraïde was unfailingly
heartened in all such nocturnal experiments by the encouragement
of her fond husband.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And do not be discouraged, wife,” he would exhort
her, as he was now exhorting upon this fine spring evening,
“for women and their belongings are, beyond
doubt, of some use or another, which by and by will
be discovered. Meanwhile, my darling, what were you
saying there is for supper? For that at least is a matter
of real importance—”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Saraïde said only, in that quick, inconsequential
childish way of hers, “O Kerin of my heart, I do so
want to know the truth about this, and about all other
matters!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, come, Saraïde! let us not despair about the
truth, either; for they tell me that truth lies somewhere
at the bottom of a well, and at virtually the door
of our home is a most notable if long dried well. Our
location is thus quite favorable, if we but keep patience.
And sooner or later the truth comes to light, they tell
me, also,—out of, it may be, the darkness of this same
abandoned Well of Ogde,—because truth is mighty and
will prevail.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No doubt,” said Saraïde: “but throughout all the
long while between now and then, my Kerin, you will
be voicing just such sentiments!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“—For truth is stranger than fiction. Yes, and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Lactantius tells us, truth will sometimes come even out
of the devil’s mouth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Saraïde fidgeted. And what now came out of her
own angelic mouth was a yawn.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Truth is not easily found,” her Kerin continued.
“The truth is hard to come to: roses and truth have
thorns about them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps,” said Saraïde. “But against banalities a
married woman has no protection whatever!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet truth,” now Kerin went on with his kindly
encouragement, “may languish, but can never perish.
Isidore of Seville records the fine saying that, though
malice may darken truth, it cannot put it out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Husband of mine,” said Saraïde, “sometimes I find
your wisdom such that I wonder how I ever came to
marry you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Kerin waved aside her tribute modestly. “It is
merely that I, too, admire the truth. For truth is the
best buckler. Truth never grows old. Truth, in the
words of Tertullian, seeks no corners. Truth makes
the devil blush.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good Lord!” said Saraïde. And for no reason at
all she stamped her foot.</p>

<p class='c005'>“—So everybody, in whatsoever surroundings, ought
to be as truthful as I am now, my pet, in observing
that this hour is considerably past our usual hour for
supper, and that I have had rather a hard day of it—”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Saraïde had gone from him, as if in meditation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>toward the curbing about the great and bottomless
Well of Ogde. “Among these general observations,
about devils and bucklers and supper time, I find only
one which may perhaps be helpful. Truth lies, you tell
me, at the bottom of a well just such as this well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is the contention alike of Cleanthes and of
Democritos the derider.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“May the truth not lie indeed, then, just as you suggested,
at the bottom of this identical well? For the
Zhar-Ptitza alone knows the truth about all things, and
I recall an old legend that the bird who has the true
wisdom used to nest in this part of Poictesme.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin looked over the stone ledge about the great
and bottomless Well of Ogde, peering downward as
far as might be. “I consider it improbable, dear wife,
that the Zhar-Ptitza, who is everywhere known to be
the most wise and most ancient of birds and of all
living creatures, would select such a cheerless looking
hole to live in. Still, you never can tell: the wise affect
profundity; and this well is known to be deep beyond
the knowledge of man. Now nature, as Cicero informs
us, <i>in profundo veritatem penitus abstruserit</i>—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good Lord!” said Saraïde again, but with more
emphasis. “Do you slip down there, then, like a dear
fellow, and find the truth for me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Saying this, she clapped both hands to his backside,
and she pushed her husband into the great and bottomless
Well of Ogde.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THE unexpectedness of it all, alike of Saraïde’s
assault and of the astonishing discovery that
you could fall for hundreds after hundreds of
feet, full upon your head, without getting even a bruise,
a little bewildered Kerin when he first sat up at the
bottom of the dry well. He shouted cheerily, “Wife,
wife, I am not hurt a bit!” because the fact seemed so
remarkably fortunate and so unaccountable.</p>

<p class='c005'>But at once large stones began to fall everywhere
about him, as though Saraïde upon hearing his voice
had begun desperately to heave these stones into the
well. Kerin thought this an inordinate manner of
spurring him onward in the quest of knowledge and
truth, because the habitual impetuosity of Saraïde, when
thus expressed with cobblestones, would infallibly have
been his death had he not sought shelter in the opening
he very luckily found to the southwest side. There
was really no understanding these women who married
you, Kerin reflected, as after crawling for a while
upon hands and feet, he came to a yet larger opening,
in which he could stand erect.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>But this passage led Kerin presently to an underground
lake, which filled all that part of the cavern,
so that he could venture no farther. Instead, he sat
down upon the borders of these gloomy and endless
looking waters. He could see these waters because of
the many ignes fatui, such as are called corpse candles,
which flickered and danced above the dark lake’s surface
everywhere.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin in such dismal circumstances began to pray.
He loyally gave precedence to his own faith, and said,
first, all the prayers of his church that he could remember.
He addressed such saints as seemed appropriate,
and when, after the liveliest representation of
Kerin’s plight, sixteen of them had failed, in any
visible way to intervene, then Kerin tried the Angels,
Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominions, Virtues,
Powers, Principalities, and Archangels.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet later, when no response whatever was vouchsafed
by any member of this celestial hierarchy, Kerin
inferred that he had, no doubt, in falling so far, descended
into heretical regions and into the nefarious
control of unchristian deities. So he now prayed to
all the accursed gods of the heathen that he could remember
as being most potent in dark places. He
prayed to Aïdoneus the Laughterless, the Much-Receiving,
the People-Collecting, the Invincible and the
Hateful; to the implacable Kerês, those most dreadful
cave-dwellers who are nourished by the blood of slain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>warriors; to the gloom-roaming Erinnyes, to the Gray-Maids,
to the Snatchers, and, most fervently, to Korê,
that hidden and very lovely sable-vested Virgin to
whom belonged, men said, all the dim underworld.</p>

<p class='c005'>But nothing happened.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Kerin tried new targets for his praying. He
addressed himself to Susanoö, that emperor of darkness
who was used to beget children by chewing up a
sword and spitting out the pieces; to Ekchuah, the
Old Black One, who at least chewed nothing with his
one tooth; to the red Maruts, patched together from
the bits of a shattered divine embryo; to Onniont, the
great, horned, brown and yellow serpent, whose lair
might well be hereabouts; to Tethra, yet another master
of underground places; to Apep also, and to Set,
and to Uhat, the Chief of Scorpions; to Camazotz, the
Ruler of Bats; to Fenris, the wolf who waited somewhere
in a cave very like this cave, against the oncoming
time when Fenris will overthrow and devour
God the All-Mighty Father; and to Sraosha, who has
charge of all worlds during the night season.</p>

<p class='c005'>And still nothing happened: and Kerin could see
only endless looking waters and, above them, those monotonously
dancing corpse candles.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin nevertheless well knew, as a loyal son of the
Church, the efficacy of prayer; and he now began, in
consequence, to pray to the corpse candles, because
these might, he reflected, rank as deities in this peculiarly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>depressing place. And his comfort was considerable
when, after an ave or two, some of these drifting
lights came flitting toward him; but his surprise was
greater when he saw that each of the ignes fatui was a
living creature like a tiny phosphorescent maiden in
everything except that each had the head of a lizard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is your nature?” Kerin asked, “and what
are you doing in this cold dark place?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Should we answer either of those questions,” one
of the small monsters said, in a shrill little voice, as
though a cricket were talking, “it would be the worse
for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, by all means, do not answer! Instead, do
you tell me if knowledge and truth are to be found
hereabouts, for it is of them that I go in search.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How should we know? It was not in pursuit of
these luxuries that we came hither, very unwillingly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, how does one get out of this place?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now they all twittered together, and they flitted
around Kerin with small squeakings. “One does
not get out of this place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin did not cry pettishly, as Saraïde would have
done, “Good Lord!” Instead, he said, “Dear me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor have we any wish to leave this place,” said the
small lizard-women. “These waters hold us here with
the dark loveliness of doom; we have fallen into an
abiding hatred of these waters; we may not leave them
because of our fear. It is not possible for any man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>to imagine the cruelty of these waters. Therefore we
dance above them; and all the while that we dance we
think about warmth and food instead of about these
waters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And have you no food here nor any warmth, not
even brimstone? For I remember that, up yonder in
Poictesme, our priests were used to threaten—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We do not bother about priests any longer. But
a sort of god provides our appointed food.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, come now, that is much better. For, as I
was just saying to my wife, supper is a matter of vital
importance, after a rather hard day of it— But who
is this sort of god?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We do not know. We only know that he has nineteen
names.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My very dear little ladies,” said Kerin, “your information
appears so limited, and your brightness so
entirely physical, that I now hesitate to ask if you
know for what reason somebody is sounding that far-off
gong which I can hear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That gong means, sir, that our appointed food is
ready.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Alas, my friends, but it is quite unbearable,” declared
Kerin, “that food should be upon that side of
the dark water, and I, who have had rather a hard day
of it, should be upon this side!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no!” they reassured him, “it is not unbearable,
for we do not mind it in the least.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Then the squeaking little creatures all went away
from Kerin, flitting and skimming and twinkling over
broad waters which seemed repellently cold and very
dreadfully deep. Nevertheless, Kerin, in his desperation,—now
that no god answered his prayer, and even
the ignes fatui had deserted him, and only a great hungering
remained with Kerin in the darkness,—Kerin
now arose and went as a diver speeds into those most
unfriendly looking waters.</p>

<p class='c005'>The result was surprising and rather painful: for,
as Kerin thus discovered, these waters were not more
than two feet in depth. He stood up, a bit sheepishly,
dripping wet, and rubbing his head. Then Kerin
waded onward in a broad shallow puddle about which
there was no conceivable need to bother any god.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin thus came without any hindrance to dry land,
and to a place where the shining concourse of lizard-women
had already begun to nibble and tug and gulp.
But Kerin, after having perceived the nature of their
appointed food, and after having shivered, walked on
beyond this place, toward the light he detected a little
above him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For supper,” he observed, “is a matter of vital
importance; and it really is necessary to draw the line
somewhere.”</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>44.</i><br /><i>Fine Cordiality of Sclaug</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW Kerin seemed in the dark to be mounting
a flight of nineteen stairs. He came thus into
a vast gray corridor, inset upon the left side
with nineteen alcoves: each alcove was full of books,
and beside each alcove stood a lighted, rather large
candle as thick about as a stallion’s body. And Kerin’s
surprise was great to find, near the first alcove, that
very Sclaug with whom Kerin pleasurably remembered
having had so much chivalrous trouble and such fine
combats before, some years ago, this Sclaug had been
killed and painstakingly burned.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nevertheless, here was the old yellow gentleman intact
and prowling about restively on all fours, in just
the wolflike fashion he had formerly affected. But
after one brief snarl of surprise he stood erect; and,
rubbing together the long thin hands which were
webbed between the fingers like the feet of a frog,
Sclaug asked whatever could have brought Kerin so
far down in the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>For Kerin this instant was a bit awkward, since he
knew not quite what etiquette ought to govern re-encounters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>with persons whom you have killed. Yet
Kerin was always as ready as anybody to let bygones
be cast off. So Kerin frankly told his tale.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Sclaug embraced Kerin, and bade him welcome,
and Sclaug laughed with the thin, easy, neighing
laughter of the aged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As for what occurred at Lorcha, dear Kerin, do
not think of it any more than I do. It was in some
features unpleasant at the time: but, after all, you
burned my body without first driving a stake through
my rebellious and inventive heart, and so since then
I have not lacked amusements. And as for this knowledge
and truth of which you go in search, here is all
knowledge, in the books that I keep watch over in this
Naraka,—during the intervals between my little amusements,—for
a sort of god.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin scratched among the wiry looking black curls
of Kerin’s hair, and he again glanced up and down
the corridor. “There are certainly a great many of
them. But Saraïde desired, I think, all knowledge, so
near as I could understand her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let us take things in the order of their difficulty,”
replied Sclaug. “Do you acquire all knowledge first,
and hope for understanding later.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The courteous old gentleman then provided Kerin
with white wine and with food very gratefully unlike
that of the ignes fatui, and Sclaug placed before Kerin
one of the books.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“Let us eat first,” said Kerin, “for supper, in any
event, is a matter of vital importance, where knowledge
and truth may turn out to be only a womanish
whim.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He ate. Then Kerin began comfortably to read,
after, as he informed Sclaug, rather a hard day of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the book which Kerin had was the book
written by the patriarch Abraham in the seventy-first
year of his age: and by and by Kerin looked up from
it, and said, “Already I have learned from this book
one thing which is wholly true.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You progress speedily!” answered Sclaug. “That
is very nice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” Kerin admitted, “such is one way of describing
the matter. But no doubt other things are
equally true: and optimism, anyhow, costs nothing.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>
  <h2 class='c028'><i>45.</i><br /><i>The Gander Also Generalizes</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>SO began a snug life for Kerin. The nineteen
candles remained always as he had first seen
them, tranquilly lighting the vast windless corridor,
burning, but not ever burning down, nor guttering,
nor even needing to be snuffed: and Kerin
worked his way from one candle to another, as Kerin
read each book in every alcove. When Kerin was
tired he slept: all the while that he waked he gave to
acquiring knowledge: he had no method nor any necessity
of distinguishing between his daily and his
nocturnal studies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sclaug went out and came back intermittently,
bringing food for Kerin. Sclaug returned as a rule with
blood upon his lips and chin. When Sclaug was away,
Kerin had to make the best—a poor best,—of the company
of the garrulous large gander which lived in the
brown cage.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, also, unusual creatures, many of them not unlike
men and women, would come sometimes, during
these absences of Sclaug,—whom, for some reason or
another, they seemed to dislike,—and they invoked the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>gander, and paid his price, and ceremonies would ensue.
Ever-busy Kerin could not, of course, spare from his
reading much time to notice these ornithomantic and
probably pagan rites. Yet he endured such interruptions
philosophically; because, at least, he reflected, they
put an end for that while to the gander’s perilously
sweet and most distracting singing.</p>

<p class='c005'>And several years thus passed; and Kerin had no
worries in any manner to interrupt him except the
gander. That inconsiderate bird insisted upon singing,
with a foolish, damnable sort of charm: and so, was
continually checking Kerin’s pursuit of knowledge,
with anserine rhapsodies about beauty and mystery and
holiness and heroism and immortality, and about a variety
of other unscientific matters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For life is very marvelous,” this gander was prone
to remark, “and to the wonders of earth there is no
end appointed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I would not say that, precisely,” Kerin would
reply, good-temperedly looking up for the while from
his book, “because geology has made great progress
of late. And so, Messire Gander, I would not say
quite that. Rather, I would say that Earth is a planet
infested with the fauna best suited to survive in this
particular stage of the planet’s existence. In any case,
I finished long ago with earth, and with all ordinary
terrestrial phenomena, such as earthquakes, and the
formation of continents, and elevation of islands, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>with stars and meteorics and with cosmography in
general.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“—And of all creatures man is the most miraculous—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The study of anthropology is of course important.
So I have learned too about man, his birth and organization,
his invention and practice of the arts, his polities
at large, and about the sidereal influences which
control the horoscope and actions of each person as an
individual.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“—A child of god, a brother to the beasts—!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, now, I question too the scientific value of
zoömorphism: yet the facts about beasts, I admit, are
interesting. For example, there are two kinds of camels;
the age of the stag can be told by inspection of his
horns; the period of gestation among sheep is one hundred
and fifty days; and in the tail of the wolf is a
small lock of hair which is a supreme love charm.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You catalogue, poor Kerin,” said the gander; “you
collect your bits of knowledge as a magpie gathers shining
pebbles; you toil through one book to another book
as methodically as a worm gnaws out the same advance:
but you learn nothing, in the wasted while that
your youth goes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To the contrary, I am at this very moment learning,”
replied Kerin. “I am learning about the different
kinds of stone and marble, including lime and sand
and gypsum. I am learning that the artists who excelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>in sculpture were Phidias, Scopas and Praxiteles.
The last-named, I have just learned also, left a son
called Cephisodotos, who inherited much of his father’s
talent, and made a notably fine Group of Wrestlers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You and your wrestlers,” said the gander, “are
profoundly absurd! But time is the king of wrestlers;
and he already prepares to try a fall with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, indeed, those Wrestlers were not absurd,”
replied Kerin. “And the proof of it is that they were
for a long while the particular glory of Pergamos.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At that the gander seemed to give him up, saying,
after a little hissing: “Very well, then, do you catalogue
your facts about Pergamos and stag-horns and planets!
But I shall sing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin now for a while regarded his fellow prisoner
with a trace of mild disapproval. And Kerin said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet I catalogue verities which are well proven and
assured. But you, who live in a brown cage that is
buried deep in this gray and lonely corridor, you can
have no first-hand information as to beauty and mystery
and holiness and heroism and immortality, you
encourage people in a business of which you are ignorant,
and you sing about ardors and raptures and,
above all, about a future of which you can know nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That may very well be just why I sing of these
things so movingly. And in any event, I do not seek
to copy nature. I, on the contrary, create to divert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>me such faith and dreams as living among men would
tend to destroy. But as it is, my worshipers depart
from me drunk with my very potent music; they tread
high-heartedly, in this gray corridor, and they are devoid
of fear and parvanimity; for the effect of my
singing, like that of all great singing, is to fill my hearers
with a sentiment of their importance as moral
beings and of the greatness of their destinies.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, but,” said Kerin, “but I finished long ago with
the various schools of morals, and I am now, as I
told you, well forward in petrology. Nor shall I desist
from learning until I have come by all knowledge
and all truth which can content my Saraïde. And she,
Messire Gander, is a remarkably clear-sighted young
woman, to whom the romantic illusions which you provide
could be of no least importance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing,” returned the gander, “nothing in the
universe, is of importance, or is authentic to any serious
sense, except the illusions of romance. For man
alone of animals plays the ape to his dreams. These
axioms—poor, deaf and blinded spendthrift!—are none
the less valuable for being quoted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor are they, I suspect,” replied Kerin, “any the
less generally quoted for being bosh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With that he returned to his books; and the gander
resumed its singing.</p>

<p class='c005'>And many more years thus passed: overhead, the
legend of Manuel had come into being and was flourishing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>and before its increase the brawling bleak rough
joyous times which Kerin had known, were, howsoever
slowly, passing away from Poictesme, not ever to return.
Overhead, Count Emmerick was ruling—inefficiently
enough, but at least with a marked bent toward
the justice and mercy and kindliness imposed upon
him by the legend,—where Dom Manuel had ruled
according to his own will alone. Overhead, Dame
Niafer and Holmendis were building everywhere their
shrines and convents and hospitals; and were now beginning,
a little by a little, to persecute, with the saint’s
rather ruthless miracle-working, the fairies and the
demons and all other unorthodox spirits aboriginal to
this land; and were beginning, too, to extirpate the
human heretics who here and there had showed such
a lack of patriotism and of religious faith as to question
the legend of Manuel and the transcending future
of Poictesme.</p>

<p class='c005'>The need of doing this was a grief to Niafer and
Holmendis, as well as a troubling tax upon their hours
of leisure: but, nevertheless, as clear-headed philanthropists,
they here faced honestly the requirements of
honest faith in any as yet revealed religion,—by which
all unbelievers must be regarded as lost in any event,
and cannot be permitted to continue in life except as a
source of yet other immortal souls’ pollution and ruin.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile the gander also exalted the illusions of
romance: and Kerin read. His eyes journeyed over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>millions upon millions of pages in the while that Kerin
sat snug: and except for the gander’s perilously sweet
and most distracting singing, Kerin had no worries in
any manner to interrupt him, and no bothers whatever,
save only the increasing infirmities of his age.</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>46.</i><br /><i>Kerin Rises in the World</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THEN old Sclaug said to Kerin, who now seemed
so much older than Sclaug seemed: “It is time
for you and me to cry quits with studying: for
you have worked your way as a worm goes through
every alcove in this place, you have read every book
that was ever written; and I have seen that vigor which
destroyed me destroyed. I go into another Naraka:
and you must now return, omniscient Kerin, into the
world of men.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is well,” said Kerin, “because, after all, I
have been away from home a long while. Yes, that is
well enough, although I shall regret to leave the books
of that god of whom you told me,—and whom, by the
way, I have not yet seen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I said, of a sort of god. He is not worshiped, I
must tell you, by the very learned nor by the dull.
However!” Sclaug said, after a tiny silence, “however,
I was wondering if you have found in these books the
knowledge you were looking for?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose so,” Kerin answered, “because I have acquired
all knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“And have you found out also the truth?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, yes!” said Kerin, speaking now without hesitancy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin took down from its place the very first book
which Sclaug had given him to read, when Kerin was
yet young, the book which had been written—upon
leaves of tree bark, with the assistance of a divine
collaborator,—by the patriarch Abraham when an horror
of great darkness fell upon him in the plain of
Mamrê. This book explained the wisdom of the temple,
the various master-words of chance, the seven
ways of thwarting destiny, and one thing which is
wholly true. And Kerin half opened this book, at the
picture of an old naked eunuch who with a scythe was
hacking off the feet of a naked youth gashed everywhere
with many small wounds; then turned to a picture
of a serpent crucified; and, shrugging, put by the
book.</p>

<p class='c005'>“—For it appears,” said Kerin, “that, after all, only
one thing is wholly true. I have found nowhere any
other truth: and this one truth, revealed to us here,
is a truth which nobody will blame the patriarch for
omitting from his more widely circulated works. Nevertheless,
I have copied out every word of it, upon
this bit of paper, to show to and make glad the dear
bright eyes of my young wife.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Sclaug replied, without looking at the proffered
paper, “The truth does not matter to the dead, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>have done with all endeavor, and who can change nothing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he told Kerin good-by; and Kerin opened the
door out of which Sclaug was used to go in search of
Sclaug’s little amusements. When Kerin had passed
through this door he drew it to behind him: and in
that instant the door vanished, and Kerin stood alone
in a dim winter-wasted field, fingering no longer a copper
door-knob but only the chill air.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leafless elder-trees rose about him, not twenty paces
before Kerin was the Well of Ogde: and beyond its dilapidated
curbing, a good half of which somebody had
heaved down into the well, he saw, through wintry
twilight, the gray eight-sided house in which he had
been used to live with the young Saraïde whom many
called a witch.</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>47.</i><br /><i>Economics of Saraïde</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>KERIN went forward, beneath naked elder
boughs, toward his dear home; and he saw
coming out of the door of the gray house the
appearance of a man who vaguely passed to the right
hand of Kerin in the twilight. But a woman’s figure
waited at the door; and Kerin, still going onward,
came thus, in the November twilight, again to Saraïde.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who is that man?” said Kerin, first of all. “And
what is he doing here?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Does that matter?” Saraïde answered him, without
any outcry or other sign of surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I think it matters that a naked man with a
red shining about his body should be seen leaving here
at this hour, in the dead of winter, for it is a thing
to provoke great scandal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But nobody has seen him, Kerin, except my husband.
And certainly my own husband would not stir
up any scandal about me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin scratched his white head. “Yes, that,” said
Kerin, “that seems reasonable, according to the best
of my knowledge. And the word ‘knowledge’ reminds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>me, Saraïde, that you sent me in search of knowledge
as to why life is given to human beings, so that you
might in the light of this knowledge appropriately dispose
of your youth. Well, I have solved your problem,
and the answer is, Nobody knows. For I have acquired
all knowledge. All that any man has ever
known, I am now familiar with, from the medicinal
properties of the bark aabec to the habits of the dragonfly
called zyxomma: but no man, I find, has ever
known for what purpose life was given him, nor what
ends he may either help or hinder in any of his flounderings
about earth and water.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I remember,” Saraïde said now, as if in a faint
wonder. “I wanted, once, when I was young and when
the eye of no man went over me without lingering, then
I wanted to know the truth about everything. Yet the
truth does not really matter to the young, who are
happy; and who in any case have not the shrewdness
nor the power to change anything: and it all seems
strange and unimportant now. For you have been a
long time gone, my Kerin, and I have lived through
many years, with many and many a companion, in the
great while that you have been down yonder getting
so much knowledge from the bird who has the true
wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of whatever bird can you be talking?” said Kerin,
puzzled. “Oh, yes, now I also remember! But, no,
there is nothing in that old story, my darling, and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>is no Zhar-Ptitza in the Well of Ogde. Instead, there
is a particularly fine historical and scientific library:
and from it I have acquired all knowledge, and have
thus happily solved your problem. Nor is that the end
of the tale: for you wanted not merely knowledge but
truth also, and in consequence I have found out for
you the one thing which—according to Abraham’s divine
collaborator, in a moment of remarkable and, I
suppose, praiseworthy candor,—is wholly true. And
that truth I have neatly copied out for you upon this
bit of paper—”</p>

<p class='c005'>But there was really no understanding these women
who despatched you upon hazardous and quite lengthy
quests. For Saraïde had interrupted him without the
least sign of such delight and satisfaction, or even of
pride in her husband’s exploits, as would have seemed
only natural. And Saraïde said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“The truth does not matter to the aged. Of what
good is the truth to you or to me either, now that all
the years of our youth are gone, and nothing in our
living can be changed?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, well!” observed Kerin, comfortably, and passing
over her defects in appreciation, “so the most of
our lifetime has slipped by since I slipped over that
well-curbing! But how time flies, to be sure! Did
you say anything, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I groaned,” replied Saraïde, “to have you back
again with your frayed tags of speech and the desolation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>of your platitudes: but that does not matter
either.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, of course not: for all is well, as they say, that
ends well. So out with your talisman, and let us
quicken the golden shining which will attest the truth
I have fetched back to you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She answered rather moodily: “I have not that talisman
any longer. A man wanted it. And I gave it to
him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Since generosity is a virtue, I have no doubt that
you did well. But to what man, Saraïde, did you give
the jewel that in youth you thought was priceless?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Does that matter, now? and, indeed, how should I
remember? There have been so many men, my Kerin,
in the tumultuous and merry years that are gone by
forever. And all of them—” Here Saraïde breathed
deeply. “Oh, but I loved them, my Kerin!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is our Christian duty to love our neighbors. So
I do not doubt that, here again, you have done well.
Still, one discriminates, one is guided, even in philanthropy,
by instinctive preferences. And therefore I am
wondering for what especial reason, Saraïde, did you
love these particular persons?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They were so beautiful,” she said, “so young, so
confident in what was to be, and so pitiable! And
now some of them are gone away into the far-off parts
of earth, and some of them are gone down under the
earth in their black narrow coffins, and the husks of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>those that remain hereabouts are strange and staid and
withered and do not matter any longer. Life is a
pageant that passes very quickly, going hastily from
one darkness to another darkness with only ignes fatui
to guide; and there is no sense in it. I learned that,
Kerin, without moiling over books. But life is a fine
ardent spectacle; and I have loved the actors in it:
and I have loved their youth and their high-heartedness,
and their ungrounded faiths, and their queer
dreams, my Kerin, about their own importance and
about the greatness of the destiny that awaited them,—while
you were piddling after, of all things, the truth!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Still, if you will remember, my darling, it was you
yourself who said, as you no doubt recall, just as you
shoved me—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well! I say now that I have loved too utterly
these irrational fine things to have the heart, even now,
to disbelieve in them, entirely: and I am content.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, yes, my dear, we two may both well be content.
For we at last can settle down and live serenely
in this place, without undue indulgence in philanthropy;
and we two alone will know the one truth which is
wholly true.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good Lord!” said Saraïde; and added, incoherently,
“But you were always like that!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THEY went then, silently, from the twilight into
the darkness of the house which had been
their shared home in youth, and in which now
there was no youth and no sound and no assured light
anywhere. Yet a glow of pallidly veiled embers, not
quite extinct where all else seemed dead, showed where
the hearth would be. And Saraïde said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is droll that we have not yet seen each other’s
faces! Give me your foolish paper, Kerin of my heart,
that I may put it to some use and light this lamp.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin, a bit disconsolately, obeyed: and Saraïde
touched the low red embers with the paper which told
about the one thing which is wholly true. The paper
blazed. Kerin saw thus speedily wasted the fruit of
Kerin’s long endeavor. Saraïde had lighted her lamp.
The lamp cast everywhither now a golden shining: and
in its clear soft yellow radiancy, Saraïde was putting
fresh wood upon the fire, and making tidy her hearth.</p>

<p class='c005'>After that necessary bit of housework she turned
to her husband, and they looked at each other for the
first time since both were young. Kerin saw a bent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>dapper, not unkindly witch-woman peering up at him,
with shrewd eyes, over the handle of her broom. But
through the burning of that paper, as Kerin saw also,
their small eight-sided home had become snug and warm
and cozy looking, it even had an air of durability: and
Kerin laughed, with the thin, easy, neighing laughter
of the aged.</p>

<p class='c005'>For, after all, he reflected, it could benefit nobody
ever to recognize—either in youth or in gray age or
after death—that time, like an old envious eunuch,
must endlessly deface and maim, and make an end of,
whatever anywhere was young and strong and beautiful,
or even cozy; and that such was the one truth
which had ever been revealed to any man, assuredly.
Saraïde, for that matter, seemed to have found out for
herself, somewhere in philanthropic fields, the one
thing which was wholly true; and she seemed, also, to
prefer to ignore it, in favor of life’s unimportant,
superficial, familiar tasks.... Well, and Saraïde, as
usual, was in the right! It was the summit of actual
wisdom to treat the one thing which was wholly true
as if it were not true at all. For the truth was discomposing,
and without remedy, and was too chillingly
strange ever to be really faced: meanwhile, in the familiar
and the superficial, and in temperate bodily pleasures,
one found a certain cheerfulness....</p>

<p class='c005'>He temperately kissed his wife, and he temperately
inquired, “My darling, what is there for supper?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THUS, then, it was that, in the November following
Guivric’s encounter with the Sylan,
Kerin of Nointel came back into Poictesme, to
become yet another convert to the great legend of Manuel.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerin was converted almost instantaneously. For
when the news of Kerin’s return was public, Holmendis
soon came that way, performing very devastating
miracles en route among the various evil and ambiguous
spirits which yet lurked in the rural districts of
Poictesme. The saint was now without any mercy imprisoning
all such detected immortals right and left,
in tree-trunks and dry wells and consecrated bottles,
and condemning them in such exiguous sad quarters to
await the holy Morrow of Judgment. With Holmendis,
as his coadjutor in these praiseworthy labors, traveled
the appearance of Guivric the Sage.</p>

<p class='c005'>And when St. Holmendis and Glaum-Without-Bones
(in Guivric’s stolen body) had talked to Kerin of
Nointel about the great cult of Manuel the Redeemer
which had sprung up during Kerin’s pursuit of knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>underground, and had showed him the holy sepulchre
at Storisende and Manuel’s bright jewel-encrusted
effigy, and had told about Manuel’s ascent into
heaven, then old Kerin only blinked, with mild, considerate,
tired eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is very likely,” Kerin said, “since it was Manuel
who gave to us of Poictesme our law that all things
must go by tens forever.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, what,” said Glaum, in open but wholly amiable
surprise, “has that to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have learned that a number of other persons have
entered alive into heaven. I allude of course to Enoch,
whose smell the cherubim found so objectionable that
they recoiled from him a distance of five thousand,
three hundred and eighty miles. I allude also to Elijah;
to Eliezer, the servant of Abraham; to Hiram,
King of Tyre; to Ebed Melek the Ethiop; to Jabez, the
son of Prince Jehuda; to Bathia, the daughter of a
Pharaoh; to Sarah, the daughter of Asher; and to
Yoshua, the son of Levi, who did not go in by the
gateway, but climbed over the wall. And I consider it
quite likely that Dom Manuel would elect to make of
this company, as he did of everything else, a tenth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thereafter Holmendis said, rather dubiously,
“Well—!” And Holmendis talked again of Manuel....</p>

<p class='c005'>“That too seems likely enough,” Kerin agreed. “I
have learned that these messengers from the gods to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>our race upon earth are sent with commendable regularity
every six hundred years. The Enoch of whom
I was speaking but a moment since was the first of
them, in the six-hundredth year after Adam. Then, as
the happy upshot of a love affair between a Mongolian
empress and a rainbow, came into this world Fo-hi,
six hundred years after Enoch’s living; and six hundred
years after the days of Fo-hi was Brighou sent
to the Hindoos. At the same interval of time or thereabouts
have since come Zoroaster to the Persians, and
Thoth the Thrice Powerful to the Egyptians, and
Moses to the Jews, and Lao Tseu to the men of China,
and Paul of Tarsus to the Gentiles, and Mohammed to
the men of Islam. Mohammed flourished just six hundred
years before our Manuel. Yes, Messire Holmendis,
it seems likely enough that, here too, Manuel would
elect to make a tenth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then pious gentle old Glaum-Without-Bones began
to speak with joy and loving reverence about the glories
of Manuel’s second coming....</p>

<p class='c005'>“No doubt, dear Guivric: for I have learned that all
the great captains are coming again,” said Kerin, almost
wearily. “There is Arthur, there is Ogier, there
is Charlemagne, there is Barbarossa, there is Finn, the
son of Cumhal,—there is in every land, in fine, a foreknowledge
of that hero who will return at his appointed
time and bring with him all glory and prosperity.
Prince Siddartha also is to return, and Saoshyant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>and Alexander of Macedon, and Satan too, for
that matter, is expected to return, for his last fling, a
little before the holy Morrow of Judgment. Here
again, therefore, I consider it quite likely that Dom
Manuel may elect to make a tenth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In short, the old fellow took Poictesme’s epiphany
almost too calmly.... Glaum was satisfied, on the
ground that a conversion was a conversion, and an
outing for all the angels in heaven. But it was apparent
that Holy Holmendis did not quite like the posture
of affairs.... You could not, of course, detect
in this incurious receptiveness any skepticism; nor
could a person who went ten times too far in the way
of faith be, very rationally, termed an unbeliever. It
was, rather, as if Kerin viewed the truth without joy:
it was as if Kerin had, somehow, become over-familiar
with the sublime truths about Manuel the Redeemer
some while before he heard them; and so, was hearing
them, now at long last, without the appropriate upliftedness
and flow of spirits. Kerin merely accepted
these tremendous truths; and seemed upon the whole
to be more interested in life’s unimportant, superficial,
familiar tasks, and in his food.</p>

<p class='c005'>Holmendis must have felt that the desiderata here
were intangible. In any event, he shook his aureoled
head; and, speaking in the tongue of his native Philistia,
he said something to Glaum-Without-Bones—which
Glaum could not at all understand,—about “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>intelligentsia, so-called.” But Holmendis did not resort
to any dreadful miracle by which old Kerin might
have been appalled into a more proper excitement and
joyousness....</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet it was a very unbounded joy, and a joy indeed
at which all beholders wondered, to Kerin of Nointel,
when he saw and embraced the fine son, named Fauxpas,
who had been born to Saraïde during the fifth year of
Kerin’s studies underground. For Kerin’s studies had
informed him that such remarkably prolonged gestations
are the infallible heralds of one or another form
of greatness,—a fact evinced by the birth of Osiris
and of several other gods and of all elephants,—and
he deduced that his son would in some way or another
rise to worldly preëminence.</p>

<p class='c005'>And that inference proved to be reasonably true,
since it was this Fauxpas de Nointel who led Count
Emmerick’s troops for him in the evil days of Maugis
d’Aigremont’s rebellion, and held Poictesme for Manuel’s
son until aid came from the Comte de la Fôret.
For twelve years at least this son of Kerin was thus
preëminent among most of his associates, and twelve
years is a reasonable slice out of any man’s life. And
the eldest son of Fauxpas de Nointel was that Ralph
who married Madame Adelaide, the daughter of the
Comte de la Fôret, and the granddaughter of Dom
Manuel, and who builded at Nointel the great castle
with seven towers which still endures.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the tale tells that upon the day of the birth
of the first son begotten by Count Emmerick,
in lawful marriage and with the aid of his own
wife Radegonde, there was such a drinking of healths
and toasts as never before was known at Storisende.
The tale speaks of a most notable banquet, at which
twelve dishes were served to every two persons, with a
great plenty of the best wine and beer. In the minstrels’
gallery were fiddlers, trumpeters and drummers,
those who tossed tambourines, and those who played
upon the flute. Ten poets discoursed meanwhile of the
feats of Dom Manuel, and presented in even livelier
colors the impendent achievements of the Redeemer’s
second coming into Poictesme with a ferocious heavenly
cortège. And meanwhile also the company drank, and
the intoxication of verse was abetted with red wine and
white.</p>

<p class='c005'>Since the poems were rather long, all this resulted in
an entertainment from which the High Bailiff of Upper
Ardra went homeward hiccoughing and even more than
usually benevolent, and without any consciousness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>that misstep which had imperiled his continued stay
on earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>For Ninzian of Yair and Upper Ardra had not
wholly broken with the heroic cenatory ways of the
years wherein Dom Manuel ruled over Poictesme.
This seemed the more regrettable because Ninzian, always
a pious and philanthropic person, had otherwise
become with age appropriately staid. He in theory approved
of every one of the reforms enacted everywhere
by the Countess Niafer, and confirmed by the Countess
Radegonde; and, in practice, Ninzian was of course
a staunch supporter of his revered and intimate associate,
St. Holmendis, in all the salutary crusades against
elves and satyrs and trolls and other uncanonical survivals
from unorthodox mythologies, and against the
free-thinking of persons who questioned the legend of
Manuel, and in the holy man’s hunting down of such
demons and stringing up of such heretics, and in all
other devout labors. But there, nevertheless, was no
disputing that the benevolent and florid bailiff of Upper
Ardra had kept a taint of the robustious social customs
of Dom Manuel’s worldly heyday.</p>

<p class='c005'>It followed that Ninzian evaded none of the toasts
at Count Emmerick’s banquet and left no friend unpledged.
Instead, sleek Ninzian drank the wines of
Orléans, of Anjou and of Burgundy; of Auxerre and
Beaune, and of St. Jean and St. Porçain. He drank
Malvoisin, and Montrose, and Vernage, and Runey.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>He drank the wines of Greece, both Patras and Farnese;
he drank spiced beers; he drank muscatel; and he
drank hypocras. He did not ignore the cider nor the
pear cider; to the sweet white sparkling wine of Volnay
he confessed, and he exhibited, an especial predilection;
and he drank copiously, also, of the Alsatian sherry and
of the Hungarian tokay.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thereafter Ninzian went homeward with a pleasurable
at-randomness, for which—in a so liberal contributor
to every pious cause and persecution,—appropriate
allowances were made by St. Holmendis and
everybody else except one person only. Ninzian was
married.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THE next evening Ninzian and his wife were
walking in the garden. They were a handsome
couple, and the high-hearted love that
had been between them in their youth was a tale which
many poets had embroidered. It was an affection, too,
which had survived its consummation with so slight impairment
that Ninzian during the long while since he
had promised eternal fidelity was not known to have
begotten but one by-blow. Even that, as he was careful
to explain, was by way of charity: for well-thought-of
rich old Pettipas, the pawnbroker at Beauvillage,
had lived childlessly with his buxom young second
wife for nearly three years before Ninzian, in odd
moments, provided this deserving couple with a young
heiress.</p>

<p class='c005'>But in the main Ninzian preferred his own lean and
pietistic wife above all other women, even so long after
he had won her in the heyday of their adventurous
youth. Now they who were in the evening of life were
lighted by a golden sunset as they went upon a flagged
walkway, made of white and blue stones; and to either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>side were the small glossy leaves and the crimson flowering
of well-tended rose-bushes. They waited thus for
Holy Holmendis, their fellow laborer in multifarious
forms of church work and social betterment, for the
saint had promised to have supper with them. And
Balthis (for that was the name of Ninzian’s wife)
said, “Look, my dear, and tell me what is that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian inspected the flower-bed by the side of the
walkway, and he replied, “My darling, it appears to be
the track of a bird.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But surely there is in Poictesme no fowl with a
foot so huge!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No. But many migratory monsters pass by in the
night, on their way north, at this time of year: and,
clearly, one of some rare species has paused here to
rest. However, as I was telling you, my pet, we have
now in hand—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, but think of it, Ninzian! The print is as
big as a man’s foot!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, precious, you exaggerate! It is the track of
a largish bird,—an eagle, or perhaps a roc, or, it may
be, the Zhar-Ptitza paused here,—but it is nothing remarkable.
Besides, as I was telling you, we have already
in hand, for the edifying of the faithful, a bit of
Mary Magdalene’s haircloth, the left ring-finger of
John the Baptist, a suit of Dom Manuel’s underclothes,
and one of the smaller stones with which St. Stephen
was martyred—”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>But Balthis, he saw now, was determined not to go
on in talk about the church which Ninzian had builded
in honor of Manuel the Redeemer, and which Ninzian
was stocking with very holy relics. Instead, she asserted
with deliberation, “Ninzian, I think it is fully
as big as a man’s foot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, be it as you like, my pet!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I will not be put off in that way! Do you tread
beside it in the flower-bed there, and, by comparing the
print of your foot with the bird track, we shall easily
see which is the larger.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian was not so ruddy as he had been. Yet he
said with dignity, and lightly enough, he hoped:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Balthis, you are unreasonable. I do not intend to
get my sandals all over mud to settle any such foolish
point. The track is just the size of a man’s foot, or it
is much larger than a man’s foot, or it is smaller than
a man’s foot,—it is, in fine, of any size which you prefer.
And we will let that be the end of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So, Ninzian, you will not tread in that new-digged
earth?” said Balthis, queerly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course I will not ruin my second-best sandals
for any such foolish reason!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You trod there yesterday in your very best sandals,
Ninzian, for the reason that you were tipsy. I saw
the print you made there, in broad daylight, Ninzian,
when you had just come from drinking with a blessed
saint himself, and were reeling all over the neat ways
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>of my garden. Ninzian, it is a fearful thing to know
that when your husband walks in mud he leaves tracks
like a bird.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Ninzian was truly penitent for yesterday’s over-indulgence.
And Ninzian said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“So, you have discovered this foible of mine, after
all my carefulness! That is a great pity.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Balthis replied, with the cold non-committalness of
wives, “Pity or no, you will now have to tell me the
truth about it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>That task did, in point of fact, seem so appallingly
unavoidable that Ninzian settled down to it, with such
airiness as would have warned any wife in the world
exactly how far to trust him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, my darling, you must know that when I first
came into Poictesme, I came rather unwillingly. Our
friend St. Holmendis, I need not tell you, was, even in
the time of Dom Manuel’s incarnation in frail human
flesh, setting such a very high moral tone hereabouts,
and the holy man is so impetuous with his miracles
when anybody differs with him on religious matters,
that the prospect was not alluring. But it was necessary
that my prince should have some representative
here, as in all other places. So I came, from—well,
from down yonder—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know you came from the South, Ninzian! Everybody
knows that. But that appears to me no excuse
whatever for walking like a bird.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“As if, my dearest, it could give me any pleasure to
walk like a bird, or like a whole covey of birds! To the
contrary, I have always found this small accomplishment
in doubtful taste, it exposes one to continual comment.
But very long ago those who had served my
prince with especial distinction were all put upon this
footing, in order that true demerit might be encouraged,
and that fine sportsmanship might be preserved, and so
that, also, our adversaries in the great game might be
detecting us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Balthis fixed on him wide, scornful, terrible
eyes. After a breathless while she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ninzian, I understand. You are an evil spirit, and
you came out of hell in the appearance of a man to
work wickedness in Poictesme!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And his Balthis, as he saw with a pang of wild regret,
was horribly upset and grieved to know the thing
which her husband had so long hid away from her;
and Ninzian began to feel rather ashamed of not having
trusted her with this secret, now it was discovered.
At all events, he would try what being reasonable might
do.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Darling,” said he, with patient rationality, “no
sensible wife will ever pry into what her husband may
have been or done before she married him. Her concern
is merely with his misdemeanors after that ceremony;
and, I think, you have had no heavy reason to
complain. Nobody can for one moment assert that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Poictesme I have not led an appallingly upright and
immaculate existence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She said, indignantly: “You had fear of Holmendis!
You came all this long way to do your devil work,
and then had not the pluck to face him!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian found this just near enough the truth to be
irritating. So he spoke now with airy condescension.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Precious, it is true the lean man can work miracles,
but then, without desiring to appear boastful, I must
tell you that I have mastery of a more venerable
and blacker magic. Oh, I assure you, he could not
have exorcised or excommunicated or tried any other
of his sacerdotal trick-work upon me without sweating
for it! Still, it seemed better to avoid such painful
scenes: for when one has trouble with these saints the
supporters of both sides are apt to intervene; the skies
are blackened and the earth shakes, and whirlwinds and
meteors and thunderbolts and seraphim upset things
generally: and it all seems rather boisterous and old-fashioned.
So it really did appear more sensible, and in
better taste, to respect, at all events during his lifetime,
the well-meaning creature’s religious convictions—in
which you share, I know, my pet,—and, well!” said
Ninzian, with a shrug, “to temporize! to keep matters
comfortable all around, you understand, my darling, by
evincing a suitable interest in church work and in whatever
else appeared expected of the reputable in my surroundings.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>But Balthis was not to be soothed. “Ninzian, this is
a terrible thing for me to be learning! There was never
a husband who better knew his place, and the only
baby you ever upset me with is at the pawnbroker’s,
and Holy Church has not ever had a more loyal servitor—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” Ninzian said, quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“—But you have been a hideous demon in deep hell,
and the man that I have loved is a false seeming, and
the moment St. Holmendis ascends to bliss you mean
to go on with your foul iniquities. That is foolish of
you, because of course I would never permit it. But,
even so—! Oh, Ninzian, my faith and my happiness
are buried now in the one grave, now that all ends
between us!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian asked, still very quietly: “And do you think
I will leave you, my Balthis, because of some disarranged
fresh earth? Could any handful of dirt have
parted us when because of my great love for you I
fought the seven knights at Évre—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What chance had the poor fellows against a devil!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is the principle of the thing, my darling,—as
well as the mathematics. Also, as I was going on to
observe, you would never have been flinging mud in
my face when for your sake I overthrew Duke Oribert
and his deplorable custom of the cat and the serpent,
and cast the Spotted Dun of Lorcha down from a high
hill.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>She answered without pity: “You will be lucky to
get out of this mud with a whole skin. For it is on
this evening of the month that St. Holmendis hears
my confession, and I must confess everything, and you
know as well as I do of his devastating miracles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian, having thus failed in his appeal to the better
qualities of his wife, forthwith returned to soliciting
her powers of reason.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Balthis, my sweet, now, after all, what complaint
have you against me? You cannot help feeling that the
no doubt ill-advised rebellion in which I was concerned
in youth, unarithmeticable æons before this Earth was
thought of, took place quite long enough ago to be forgotten.
Besides, you know by experience that I am
only too easily guided by others, that I have never
learned, as you so eloquently phrase it, to have any
backbone. And I do not really see, either, how you
can want to punish me to-day for iniquities which, you
grant, I have not ever committed, but—so you assume,
without any warrant known to me—have just vaguely
thought of committing by and by, and it may be, not
for years to come—my adorable pouting darling—because
this stringy Holmendis seems tough as whit-leather—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian’s stammered talking died away. He saw
there was no moving her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Ninzian, I simply cannot stand having a husband
who walks like a bird, and is liable to be detected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>the next time it rains. It would be on my mind day
and night, and people would say all sorts of things.
No, Ninzian, it is quite out of the question. I will
get your things together at once, and you can go to
hell or over to that giggling ill-bred friend of yours at
the pawnbroker’s nasty shop, just as you elect: and I
leave it to your conscience if, after the way I have
worked and slaved for you, you had the right to play
this wrong and treachery upon me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Balthis said also: “For it is a great wrong and
treachery which you have played upon me, Ninzian of
Yair, getting from me such love as men will not find
the equal of in any of the noble places of this world
until the end of life and time. This is a deep wound
that you have given me. Upon your lips were wisdom
and pleasant talking, there was kindliness in the gray
eyes of Ninzian of Yair, your hands were strong at
sword-play, and you were the most generous of companions
all through the daytime and in the nighttime
too. These things I delighted in, these things I regarded:
I did not think of the low mire, I could not
see what horrible markings your passing by had left to
this side and to that side.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Balthis said: “Let every woman weep with me,
for I now know that to every woman’s loving is this
end appointed. There is no woman that gives all to
any man, but that woman is wasting her substance at
bed and board with a greedy stranger, and there is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>wife who escapes the bitter hour in which that knowledge
smites her. So now let us touch hands, and now
let our lips too part friendlily, because our bodies have
so long been friends, the while that we knew nothing
of each other, Ninzian of Yair, on account of the great
wrong and treachery which you have played upon me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus speaking, Balthis kissed him. Then she went
into the house that was no longer Ninzian’s home.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NINZIAN sat on a stone bench which was carved
at each end with a crouching sphinx, and he
waited there while the sunlight died away behind
the poplars. The moment could not but seem to
anybody pregnant with all danger. Holmendis was
coming, and Holmendis would very soon be hearing
the confession of Balthis, and these saints were over-often
the prey of an excitability which damaged their
cause.</p>

<p class='c005'>That impetuous Holmendis was quite as apt as not
to resort out of hand to unbridled miracle-working,
and with the fires of Heaven to annihilate his leading
fellow laborer in every exercise of altruistic intermeddling,—without
pausing, rationally, to reflect what an
annihilation the resultant scandal would be to Holmendis’
own party of reform and uplift. Holmendis
would no doubt be sorry afterward: but he would get
no sympathy from Ninzian.</p>

<p class='c005'>And, meanwhile, Ninzian loved his wife so greatly
that prolonged existence without her did not tempt him.
His wife, whoever she might be, had always seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>peculiarly dear to Ninzian. And now, as he looked
back upon the exceeding love which he had borne his
wife, in Nineveh and Thebes and Tyre and Babylon
and Rome and Byzantium, and in all other cities that
bred fine women, and as he weighed the evanescence
of this love which was evading him after these few
thousand years, it seemed to Ninzian a pitiable thing
that his season of earthly contentment should thus be
cut off in its flower and withered untimelily.</p>

<p class='c005'>And his conscience troubled him, too. For the fiend
had not been entirely candid with his Balthis, and
Poictesme was not by any means the stage of the complaisant
easy-going fellow’s primal failure. So he now
forlornly thought of how utterly he had failed in his
mission upon Earth, ever since he first came to Mount
Kaf to work evil among men, in the time of King
Tchagi, a great while before the Deluge; and he considered
with dismay the appalling catalogue of virtuous
actions into which these women had betrayed him.</p>

<p class='c005'>For always the cause of Ninzian’s downfall had
been the same: he would get to talking indiscretion to
some lovely girl or another, just through his desire to
be agreeable to everybody, and his devilish eloquence
would so get the better of her that the girl would invariably
marry him and ruthlessly set about making
her husband a well-thought-of citizen. Nor did it avail
him to argue. Women nowhere appeared to have any
sympathy with Ninzian’s appointed labor upon Earth:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>they seemed to have an instinctive bent toward Heaven
and the public profession of every virtue. Just as in
the case of that poor Miramon Lluagor, Ninzian reflected,
Ninzian’s wife also did not care two straws
about her husband’s career and the proper development
of his talents.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Ninzian on a sudden recollected the cause of
the disturbance which had been put upon his living.
He drew his dagger, and, squatting on the paved walkway,
he scratched out that incriminating footprint.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was none too soon.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c008' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>
  <h2 class='c028'><i>53.</i><br /><i>Continuation of Appalling Pieties</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>HE was none too soon, because Ninzian rose
from this erasement just in time to bump into
no other than the energetic tough flesh of
Holy Holmendis, who in the cool of the evening was
coming up the walkway; and indeed, in rising, Ninzian
jostled against the saint rather roughly. So Ninzian
apologized for his clumsiness, and explained that
he was going fishing the next day, and was digging for
worms: and Ninzian was in a bad taking, for he could
not know how much this peppery and over-excitable
saint from out of Philistia had seen or suspected, or
might be up to the very next moment with one or another
bull-headed miracle.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Holy Holmendis said friendlily that no bones
were broken, and he went on, with the soul-chilling
joviality of the clergy, to make some depressing joke
about fishers of men. “And that is why I am here,”
said the saint, “for this evening Dame Balthis is to
confess to me whatever matters may be on her conscience.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, yes,” said Ninzian, fondly, “but we both know,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>my dear and honored friend, that Balthis has a particularly
tender conscience, a conscience which is as
sensitive to the missteps of others as a sore toe.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is how everybody’s conscience ought to be,”
returned the saint: and he went on to speak of the
virtuous woman who is a crown to her husband. And
he made a contrast between the fine high worth of
Balthis and the shamelessness of that bad beggar-woman
upon whom, just outside the gate, the saint
had put apoplexy and divine fire for speaking over-lightly
of the second coming of Manuel.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian fidgeted. He of course said sympathizingly
that he would send some servants to remove the blasted
carcass, and that it ought to be a lesson, and that there
was no telling what the world was coming to unless
right-thinking persons took strong steps through the
proper channels. Nevertheless, he did not like the
hard, pinched little mouth and glittering, very pale blue
eyes of this gaunt saint; and the nimbus about the
thick white hair of Holy Holmendis was beginning to
shine brighter and brighter as the dusk of evening
thickened. Ninzian found it uncomfortable to be alone
with this worker of miracles; piety is in all things so
unpredictable: and Ninzian was unfeignedly glad when
Balthis came out of the loved house that was no longer
Ninzian’s home, and when Balthis held open the door
for Holmendis to enter where Ninzian might not come
any more.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Yet, so tenacious is the charitableness of women,
that even now, as Holmendis went in, Dame Balthis
tried to speak, for the last time, sensibly and kindly
with her husband.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pig with the head of a mule,” she said, in a lowered
tone, “do you stop looking at me like a sick calf,
and go away! For I must confess in what a state of
sin I have been living, as a devil’s wife, and I have
little faith in your black magic, and you know as well
as I do that there is no telling what blasted tree-trunk
or consecrated bottle or something of that sort he may
seal you up in until the holy Morrow of Judgment,
precisely as he has done all those other evil spirits.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian replied, “I shall not ever leave you of my
free will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Ninzian, it is as if I were putting you into the
bottle, myself! For if I do not tell that spiteful old
bag of bones”—she crossed herself,—“I mean, that
beloved and blessed saint, why, he would never have
the sense, or rather, I intended to say that his faith in
his fellow creatures is too great and admirable for him
ever to suspect you, and so you just see how it is!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, my most cruel love,” said Ninzian, “it is quite
as if you yourself were thrusting me into a brazen
bottle, for all that you know how dependent I am on
open-air exercise, and as if you were setting to it the
unbreakable seal of Sulieman-ben-Daoud with your own
dear hands. But, nevertheless—!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>He took her hand, and gallantly he kissed her finger-tips.</p>

<p class='c005'>At that she boxed his jaws. “You need not think
to make a fool of me! no, not again, not after all these
years! Oh, but I will show you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Balthis also went into the house where the
gaunt saint was making ready to hear her mensual
confession.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>POOR-SPIRITED, over-easy-going Ninzian sat
upon the stone bench, an outcast now in his
own garden: and he thought for a while about
the pitiless miracles with which this Holmendis had
harried the fairies and the elves and the salamanders
and the trolls and the calcars and the succubæ and all
the other amiable iniquities of Poictesme; and about
the saint’s devastating crusades against moral laxity
and free-thinking and the curt conclusions which he
had made with his ropes and his fires to the existence
of mere heresy. It seemed uncomfortably likely that
in dealing with a devil this violent and untactful Holmendis
would go to even greater lengths, and would
cast off all compunction, if somehow Ninzian could
not get the better of him.</p>

<p class='c005'>So Ninzian decided to stay upon the safe side of accident,
by destroying the fellow out of hand. Ninzian
took from his pocket the stone ematille, and he broke
off a branch from a rose-bush. With the flowering
rose branch Ninzian traced a largish circle about his
sleek person, saying, “I infernalize unto myself the circumference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>of nine feet about me.” Here the sign of
Sargatanet was repeated by him thrice. Then Ninzian
went on, “From the east, Glavrab; from the west, Garron;
from the north—”</p>

<p class='c005'>He paused. He scratched his head. The boreal
word of power was Cabinet or Cabochon or Capricorn
or something of that kind, he knew: but what it was
exactly was exactly what Ninzian had forgotten. He
would have to try something else.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian therefore turned to the overthrowing of
Holmendis by cold and by heat. Ninzian said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I invoke thee who art in the empty wind, terrible,
invisible, all-potent contriver of destruction and bringer
of desolation. I upraise before thee that rod from
which proceeds the life abhorrent to thee. I invoke
thee through thy veritable name, in virtue of which
thou canst not refuse to
hear,—<span class='sc'>Joerbet-Jopaker-beth-Jobolchoseth</span>—”</p>

<p class='c005'>But there he gave it up. That dreadful, jaw-cracking
obscene appellation had, Ninzian recollected, eleven
more sections: but in bewildered Ninzian’s mind they
were all jumbled and muddled and hopelessly confused.</p>

<p class='c005'>After that a rather troubled High Bailiff rearranged
his clothing; and he now tried to get in touch with
Nebiros, the Field-Marshal and Inspector General of
Hell. But again Ninzian was in his magic deplorably
rusty.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i>Agla, Tagla, Malthon, Oarios</i>—” he rattled off,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>handily enough,—and once more he bogged in an appalling
stretch of unrememberably difficult words.
Black magic was not an accomplishment in which you
could stay expert without continual practice; and Ninzian
had regrettably neglected all infernal arts for the
last five centuries and over.</p>

<p class='c005'>So in this desperate pinch he turned perforce to a
simple abecedary conjuration such as mere wizards
used; and the High Bailiff of Upper Ardra said,
rather shame-facedly, “Prince Lucifer, most dreadful
master of all the Revolted Spirits, I entreat thee to
favor me in the adjuration which I address to thy
mighty minister, Lucifugé Rofocalé, being desirous to
make a pact with him—”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Ninzian got through this invocation at least,
quite nicely, though he a trifle bungled the concluding
words from the Grand Clavicle.</p>

<p class='c005'>This conjuration, however, worked a bit too well.
For instead of the hoped-for appearance of genial old
Lucifugé Rofocalé endurably disinfected of his usual
odor, now came to Ninzian, from among the sweet-smelling
rose-bushes, the appearance of a proud gentleman
in gold and sable: and a rather perturbed Ninzian
bowed very low before his liege-lord, Lucifer, Prince
over all the Fallen Angels.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THE newcomer paused for an instant, as if he
were reading what was in the troubled mind
of Ninzian, and then he said: “I see. Surkrag,
whom mortals hereabouts call Ninzian! O unfaithful
servant, now must you be punished for betraying
the faith I put in you. Now is your requital
coming swiftly from this ravening saint, who will dispose
of you without mercy. For your conjuring would
disgrace a baby in diapers; you have forgotten long
ago what little magic you ever knew; and when this
Holmendis gets hold of you with one hand and exorcises
you with the other, there will be hardly a cinder
left.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So did Ninzian know himself to stand friendlessly,
between the wrath of evil and the malignity of holiness,
both bent upon his ruin. He said, “Have patience,
my prince!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Lucifer answered sternly: “My patience is outworn.
No, Surkrag, there is no hope for you, and
you become shameless in perfidy as steadily you go
from good to better. Once you would have scorned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>the least deviation from the faith you owe me: but a
little by a little you have made compromises with virtue,
through your weak desire to live comfortably with
your wives, and this continual indulgence of women’s
notions is draining from you the last drop of wickedness.
Not fifty centuries ago you would have been
shocked by a kindly thought. Twenty centuries back
and you at least retained a proper feeling toward the
Decalogue. Now you assist in all reforms and build
churches without a blush. For is there nowadays, my
deluded, lost Surkrag! in candor, is there any virtue
howsoever exalted, is there a single revolting decency
or any form of godliness, before which your gorge
rises? No, my poor friend: you came hither to corrupt
mankind, and instead they have made you little
worse than human.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Angel of Darkness paused. He had spoken, as
became such a famous gentleman, very temperately,
without rage, but also without any concealing of his
sorrow and disappointment. And Ninzian answered,
contritely:</p>

<p class='c005'>“My prince, I have not wholly kept faith, I know.
But always the woman tempted me with the droll notion
that our sports ought to open with a religious
service, and so I have been now and then seduced into
marriage. And my wife, no matter what eyes and
hair and tint of flesh she might be wearing at the time,
has always been bent upon having her husband looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>up to by the neighbors; and in such circumstances a
poor devil has no chance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So that these women have been your ruin, and even
now the latest of them is betraying your secret to that
implacable saint! Well, it is honest infernal justice,
for since the time of Kaïumarth you have gained me
not one follower in this place, and have lived openly
in all manner of virtue when you should have been
furthering my power upon Earth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus speaking, Lucifer took his seat upon the bench.
Then Ninzian too sat down, and Ninzian leaned toward
this other immortal, in the ever-thickening dusk; and
Ninzian’s plump face was sad.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My prince, what does it matter? From the first I
have let my fond wife have her will with me, because
it pleased her, and did no real good. What do these
human notions matter, even in so dear a form? A
little while and Balthis will be dead. A little while and
there will be no Yair nor Upper Ardra, and no shining
holy sepulchre at Storisende, and all Poictesme will be
forgotten. A little while and this Earth will be an icecold
cinder. But you and I shall still be about our
work, still playing for the universe, with stars and suns
for counters. Does it really matter to you that, for
the time this tiny trundling Earth exists and has
women on it, I pause from playing at the great game,
to entertain myself with these happy accidents of nature?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Lucifer replied: “It is not only your waste of time
that troubles me. It is your shirking of every infernal
duty, it is your cherubic lack of seriousness. Why, do
you but think how many thousand women have passed
through your fingers!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, like a string of pearls, my prince,” said Ninzian,
fondly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is that not childish sport for you that used to contend
so mightily in the great game?”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Ninzian now was plucking up heart, as the saying
is, hand over fist. “Recall the old days, my prince,”
he urged, with the appropriate emotional quaver, “when
we two were only cherubs, with no bodies as yet
sprouted from our little curly heads! Do you recall
the merry romps and the kissing games we had as tiny
angel-faces, sporting together so lovingly among the
golden clouds of heaven, without any cares whatever,
and with that collar of wings tickling so drolly one’s
ears! and do you let the memory move you, even to unmerited
indulgence. I have contracted an odd fancy
for this inconspicuous sphere of rock and mud, I like
the women that walk glowingly about it. Oh, I concede
my taste is disputable—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dispute nothing, Surkrag. I merely point out that
lechery is nowhere a generally received excuse for good
works.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, but now and then,” said Ninzian, broadmindedly,
“the most conscientious may slip into beneficence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>And, in any case, how does it matter what I
do on Earth? Frankly, my prince, I think you take the
place too seriously. For centuries I have watched those
who serve you going about this planet in all manner of
quaint guises, in curious masks which are impenetrable
to any one who does not know that your preëminent
servitors tread with the footfall of a bird wherever
they pass upon your errands—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, but—” said Lucifer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“—For ages,” Ninzian continued, without heeding
him, “I have seen your emissaries devote much time
and cunning to the tempting of men to commit wickedness:
and to what end? Man rises from the dust: he
struts and postures: he falls back into the dust. That
is all. How can this midge work good or evil? His
virtue passes as a thin scolding: the utmost reach of
his iniquity is to indulge in the misdemeanor of
supererogation, by destroying a man or two men, whom
time would very soon destroy in any event. Meanwhile
his sympathies incline—I know,—by a hair-breadth or
so, toward Heaven. Yes, but what does it matter? is
it even a compliment to Heaven? Ah, prince, had I the
say, I would leave men to perish in their unimportant
starveling virtues, without raising all this pother over
trifles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian could see that he had made a perceptible impression:
yet still, dark Lucifer was shaking his head.
“Surkrag, in abstract reason you may be right: but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>warfare is not conducted by reason, and to surrender
anything to the Adversary, though it were no more
than Earth and its inhabitants, would be a dangerous
example.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, prince, do you think how many first class
constellations there are to strive for, made up of stars
that are really desirable possessions! Turn that fine
mind of yours to considerations worthy of it, sir! Consider
Cassiopeia, and the Bull, and the dear little Triangle!
and do you think about Orion, containing such
sidereal masterpieces as Bellatrix and Betelgeuse and
Rigel, and the most magnificent nebula known anywhere!
Do you think also about that very interesting
triple sun which is called Mizar, in the Great Bear, a
veritable treasure for any connoisseur! and do you let
me have this Earth to amuse me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Lucifer did not answer at once. The bats were
out by this time, zigzagging about the garden: the air
was touched with the scent of dew-drenched roses: and
somewhere in the dusk a nightingale had tentatively
raised its thrilling, long-drawn, plaintive voicing of desire.
All everywhere about the two fiends was most
soothing. And the Angel of Darkness laughed without
a trace left in his manner of that earlier reserve.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no, old wheedler! one cannot neglect the tiniest
point, in the great game. Besides, I have my pride, I
confess it, and to behold Earth given over entirely to
good would vex me. Yet, after all, I can detect no unforgivable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>beneficence in your continuing to live virtuously
here with your seraglio for such a while as the
planet may last. These little holidays even freshen one
for work. So, if you like, I will summon Amaimon or
Baälzebub, or perhaps Succor-Benoth would enjoy the
sport, and they will dispose of this two-penny saint.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Ninzian seemed hesitant. “My prince, I am
afraid that some of those officious archangels would be
coming too; and one thing might lead to another, and
my wife would not at all like having any supernal battlings
in her own garden, among her favorite rose-bushes.
No, as I always say, it is much better to avoid
these painful scenes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your wife!” said Lucifer, in high astonishment,
“and is it that thin faded pious wretch you are considering!
Why, but your wife has repudiated you!
She has caught just your trick of treacherousness, and
so she has betrayed you to that flint-hearted saint!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ninzian in the dusk made bold to smile....</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NINZIAN in the dusk made bold to smile at
this sort of bachelor talk. Lucifer really would
be a bit more broad-minded, a shade less notably
naïve, if only the dear fellow had not stayed always
so stubbornly prejudiced against marriage, merely
because it was a sacrament. All that was required,
alike to perfect him in some real knowledge of human
nature and to secure everybody’s well-being everywhere,
Ninzian reflected, was for Lucifer just once to marry
some capable woman....</p>

<p class='c005'>So Ninzian smiled. But Ninzian did not need to say
anything, for at this moment Balthis came to the door,
and—not being able in the twilight to see the Prince of
Darkness,—she called out that supper was getting stone-cold
on the table, and that she really wished Ninzian
would try to be a little more considerate, especially
when they had company.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Ninzian, rising, chuckled. “My wife has been
like that since Sidon was a village. Time and again
she has found me out; and never yet has she let me
off with a public exposure. Oh, if I could explain it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>I would perhaps care less for her. In part, I think,
it means that she loves me: in part, I fear—upon looking
back,—it means that no really conscientious person
cares to entrust the proper punishment of her husband
to anybody else. Of course, all that is merely theory.
What is certain is that my wife’s confession has been
conducted tactfully, and that you and I are going in
to talk solemn nonsense with St. Holmendis.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Lucifer once more was shaking his head. He
said, with firmness:</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Surkrag. No, I am not squeamish, but I have
no use for saints.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, prince, I would not be over-hasty to agree
with you. For Holmendis has some invaluable points.
He is perfectly sincere, for one thing, and for another,
he is energetic, and for a third, he never pardons any
one who differs with him. Of course, he is all for
having men better than they were intended to be, and
with his tales about that second coming of Manuel he
does frighten people.... For they have been altering
that legend, my prince, considerably. Nowadays,
it is not only glory and prosperity which Manuel is to
bring back with him. He is to return also, it seems,
with a large cargo of excruciate punishments for all
persons who differ in any way with the notions of
Holmendis and Niafer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, the old story! It is really astounding,” Lucifer
commented, in frank wonder, “how one finds everywhere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>this legend of the Redeemer in just this form.
It seems an instinct with the creatures.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, but,” said Ninzian, tolerantly, “it gives them
something to look forward to. It promises to gratify
all their congenital desires, including cruelty. And,
above all, it prevents their going mad, to believe that
somebody somewhere is looking out for them. In any
event,—as I was saying,—this gaunt Holmendis does
frighten Poictesme into a great deal of public piety.
Still, there are always corners and bedrooms and other
secluded places, in which one strikes a balance, as it
were; and abstinence and fear make wonderful appetizers:
so that, in the long run of affairs, I doubt if
you have anywhere upon Earth any more serviceable
friends than are these saints who will put up with
nothing short of their own especial sort of perfection.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lucifer was not convinced. “It is proper of course
that you should attempt to exculpate your friend and
associate during the last twenty years. Nevertheless,
all these extenuatory sayings, about the viciousness of
virtue, are the habitual banalities of boyhood; and no
beardless cynic, even when addicted to verse, has ever
yet been permanently injured by them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” Ninzian returned, “but here, I am not merely
theorizing. I speak with rather high authority. For
you will be remembering, prince, that, by the rules of
our game, when any mortal has gained a hundred followers
for you, Jahveh is penalized to put him upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>the same footing as the rest of us. And, well, sir!
you may see here in the mud, just where I jostled Holmendis
from the walkway—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lucifer made luminous his finger-tips, and held them
like five candles to the saint’s footprint. The Angel
of Darkness bowed thereafter, with real respect, toward
heaven.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Our Adversary, to do Him justice, keeps an honest
score. Come, Surkrag, now this is affecting! This
very touchingly recalls that the great game is being
played by the dear fellow with candor and fine sportsmanship.
Meanwhile I must most certainly have supper
with you; and the great game is far from over,
since I yet make a fourth with the fanatic, the woman
and the hypocrite.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, prince,” said Ninzian, a little shocked, as they
went into his sedate snug home, “should you not say
more tactfully, with us three leaders of reform?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the tale speaks of the rebellion of Maugis,
who was the son of Donander of Évre, the
Thane of Aigremont. For Count Manuel’s
youngest child, Ettarre, born after her father’s passing,
was now come to the full flowering of her strange
beauty: and it was at this time—with the result that
two young gentlemen went out of their wits, four
killed themselves, and seven married,—that Ettarre was
betrothed to Guiron des Rocques, of the famous house
of Gâtinais. And it was at this time also that young
Maugis d’Aigremont resorted to a more stirring solace
than might be looked for in imbecility or death or a
vicarious bedfellow. He seized and carried off Ettarre.
His company of ten was pursued by Count Emmerick
and Guiron with twenty followers; and after a skirmish
in Bovion the girl was recaptured unharmed.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Maugis escaped. And after that he went into
open rebellion against Count Emmerick’s authority,
and occupied those fastnesses in the Taunenfels which
Othmar Black-Tooth had once held for a long while
against the assaults of Count Manuel himself.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>History in fine appeared to honor banality by repeating
itself, with the plain difference that gaunt Maugis
was equally a great captain and a great lover and in
every way more formidable than Othmar had been,
whereas Emmerick, elsewhere than at a banquet, was
not formidable at all. Moreover, Emmerick in these
days lacked even any stronger kinsman to lean upon,
for his brother-in-law Heitman Michael was now in
Muscovy, the young Count of Montors was dead, and
Ayrart de Montors had removed to the court of King
Theodoret. Emmerick had, thus, to lead his troops
only Fauxpas de Nointel and that unreasonable Guiron,
who expected Emmerick himself to lead them.</p>

<p class='c005'>So Emmerick wavered; he made terms; he even
winked at Guiron’s capture by the pirates of Caer
Idryn, in order to be rid of this troublesome posturer
who insisted upon dragging Emmerick into so much
uncomfortable fighting: and Maugis, since these terms
did not include his possession of Ettarre, soon broke
them. Thus the warring that now arose in Poictesme,
between Maugis’ lust and Count Emmerick’s supineness,
dragged on for many wearying fevered years.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Madame Melicent returned from oversea with
her second husband, the Comte de la Fôret, a gentleman
who remarkably lacked patience with brigands and
with shilly-shallying. This Perion de la Fôret took
charge of matters, with such resolution that out of
hand Guiron was rescued from his captivity, Maugis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>was overpowered and killed, the Ettarre whom he had
desired to his own hurt was married to Guiron, and
Count Emmerick gave a banquet in honor of the event.
Such was this Perion’s impetuosity.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is of these matters that the tale speaks in passing.
For the tale now is of Donander of Évre, who was the
father of Maugis, and who would not break faith with
that Emmerick who, howsoever unworthily, sat in the
place of that great master whom Donander had been
privileged to serve even in this mortal life. For Donander
was the only one of the lords of the Silver
Stallion who accepted with joy and with unbounded
faith the legend of Manuel, and who in all his living
bore testimony to it.</p>

<p class='c005'>This Donander of Évre had been the youngest of
the fellowship, he was at this time but newly made a
widower while yet in his forties, and whatsoever he
lacked in brilliance of wit he atoned for with his hardiness
in battle. Yet in this war he chose not to display
his prowess, since the fighting was between the son of
Dom Manuel and the son of Donander himself. He
chose instead exile.</p>

<p class='c005'>First, though, he went to Storisende; and, standing
beside the holy sepulchre, he looked up for some while
at the serene great effigy of Manuel, poised there in
eternal watchfulness over Donander’s native land, and
bright with all the jewels of the world. Donander knelt
and prayed in this sacred place, as he knew, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>last time. Then Donander, without any complaining,
and without any grieving now for his wife’s death,
went out of Poictesme, a landless man; and he piously
took service under Prince Balein of Targamon (the
same that twenty years ago had wooed Queen Morvyth,
a little before the evil times of her long imprisonment
and the cutting off of her head), who now was
harrying the pagan Northmen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus it was that Donander also at the last went out
of Poictesme, not by his own election, to encounter
the most strange of all the dooms which befell the lords
of the Silver Stallion after the passing of Dom Manuel.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THIS doom began its workings in the long field
below Rathgor, when Palnatoki rode forth and
made his brag. “I am the champion of the
Ænseis. In the Northland there is nobody mightier
than I; and if a mightier person live elsewhere, it is
not yet proven. Who is there in this place will try a
fall with me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Behind him the pagan army waited, innumerable,
and terrible, and deplorably ill-mannered. These
shouted now:</p>

<p class='c005'>“We cry a holmgang. Who will fight with Red
Palnatoki, that is overlord of the Swan’s bath, and
that slew the giants in Noenhir?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then from the opposed ranks came clanking, and
shining in full armor, Donander of Évre. And he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I, howsoever unworthy, messire, am the person
who will withstand you. I also have fought before this
morning. Under Count Manuel’s banner of the Silver
Stallion I have done what I might. That much I will
again do here to-day, and upon every day between this
day and the holy Morrow of Judgment.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>After that the Christian army shouted: “There is
none mightier than Donander! Also, he is very gratifyingly
modest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Palnatoki cried out scornfully: “Your utmost
will not avail this morning! Behind me musters all
the might of the Ænseis, that are the most high of
gods above Lærath, and their strength shall be shown
here through me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Behind the endeavors of every loyal son of the
Church,” Donander said, “are the blessed saints and
the bright archangels.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed, Donander, that may very well be the truth,”
replied Red Palnatoki. “The old gods and the gods
of Rome have met to-day; and we are their swords.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your gods confess their weakness, Messire Palnatoki,
by picking the better weapon,” Donander answered
him, courteously.</p>

<p class='c005'>With these amenities discharged, they fought. Nowhere
upon earth could have been found a pair of more
stalwart warriors: each had no equal anywhere existent
between seas and mountains save in his adversary:
so neatly were they matched indeed that, after a half-hour
of incredible battling, it was natural enough they
should kill each other simultaneously. And then the
unfortunate error occurred, just as each naked soul
escaped from the dying body.</p>

<p class='c005'>For now out of the north came Kjalar, the fair
guide of pagan warriors to eternal delights in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Hall of the Chosen; and from the zenith sped, like a
shining plummet, Ithuriel to fetch the soul of the
brave champion of Christendom to the felicities of the
golden city walled about with jasper of the Lord God
of Sabaoth. Both emissaries had been attending the
combat until the arrival of their part therein; both, as
seasoned virtuosi of warfare, had been delighted by
this uncommonly fine fight: and in their pleased excitement
they somehow made the error of retrieving each
the other’s appointed prey. It happened thus that the
soul of Donander of Évre fared northward, asleep
in the palm of Kjalar’s hand, while Ithuriel conveyed
the soul of Red Palnatoki to the heaven of Jahveh.</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>59.</i><br /><i>The Conversion of Palnatoki</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>ITHURIEL’S blunder, it is gratifying to record,
did not in the outcome really matter. For Christendom
just then was at heated odds over points
of theology not very clearly understood in Jahveh’s
heaven, where in consequence no decisions were hazarded
upon the merits of the controversy; and the
daily invoices of Christian champions and martyrs of
all sects were being admitted to blessedness as fast as
they murdered one another.</p>

<p class='c005'>Moreover, Red Palnatoki was, by the articles of his
stern Nordic creed, a fatalist. When he discovered
what had happened, and the strange salvation which
had been put upon him, his religion therefore assured
him that this too had been predestined by the wayward
Norns, and he piously made no complaining.
The eternal life which he had inherited, with no fighting
in it for the present, and no stronger drink than
milk, was not up to human expectation, but the tall
sea-rover had long ago found out that few things are.
Meanwhile he could, at any rate, look forward to that
promised last great battle, when those praiseworthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>captains Gog and Magog (with, as Palnatoki understood
it, a considerable company of fine fighting-men),
would attack the four-square city, and when Palnatoki
would have again a chance really to enjoy himself in
defending the camp of the saints.</p>

<p class='c005'>And meanwhile too, he was interested in those girls.
It seemed at best to any one with his religious rearing
quite unaccountable to find women in heaven, and this
especial pair appeared to Palnatoki a remarkably quaint
choice for exceptional favoritism. He could only deduce
they had got in through some error similar to
that which had procured his own admission, particularly
as he saw no other women anywhere about.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Palnatoki reflected that the enceinte lady, with
eagle’s wings and the crown of little stars, whom the
presumably pet dragon followed everywhere with
touching devotion, could not for as yet some months
repay cultivating. But that very pretty brunette, with
the golden cup and all those splendid clothes and with
the placard on her forehead, who had just ridden by
upon that seven-headed scarlet monster, rather took
Palnatoki’s fancy. That girl was not, you could see,
a prude; she had come very near winking at him, if
she, indeed, had not actually winked in the moment she
glanced back: so that the Great Whore of Babylon
(which, as they told him, was this second lady’s name)
gave him, upon the whole, something else to look forward
to.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Without any sulking under his halo, Palnatoki bent
resolutely to his first harp-lesson; and, in place of protests,
civilly voiced alleluias.</p>

<p class='c005'>For, with two fine to-morrows to look forward to,
Palnatoki was content enough. And in Jahveh’s
heaven, therefore, all went agreeably, and as smoothly
as Red Palnatoki at just this point goes out of this
story.</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>60.</i><br /><i>In the Hall of the Chosen</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>WHEN Donander of Évre awoke in the Northern
paradise, he also was content enough. It
was a strange and not what you could call a
cozy place, this gold-roofed hall with its five hundred
and forty mile-wide doors: and the monsters, in the
likeness of a stag and of a she-goat, which straddled
above the building perpetually feeding upon the lower
leaves of the great tree called Lærath, seemed to Donander
preëminently outlandish creatures, animals under
whose bellies no really considerate persons would have
erected a residence. Yet, like Palnatoki, Donander of
Évre was an old campaigner, who could be tolerably
comfortable anywhere. Nor was to discover himself
among pagans a novel experience, since in his mortal
life Donander had ridden at adventure in most corners
of the world, and rather more than half of his finest
enemies and of his opponents in many delightful encounters
had been infidels.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Excepting always their unfortunate religious heresies,”
he was used to concede, “I have no fault to pick
with heathen persons, whom in the daily and nocturnal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>affairs of life I have found quite as friendly and companionable
as properly baptized ladies.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In fine, he got on well enough with the flaxen-haired
spirits of these Northern kings and skalds and jarls
and vikingar. They stared, and some guffawed, when
he fitted out a little shrine, in which Donander prayed
decorously, every day at the correct hours, for the second
coming of Manuel and for the welfare of Donander’s
soul upon the holy Morrow of Judgment. Yet,
after all, these boreal ghosts conceded, in paradise if
anywhere a man should be permitted utterly to follow
his own tastes, even in imaginative eschatology. And
when they talked their really pathetic nonsense about
being the guests of Sidvrar the Weaver and Constrainer,
and about living forever through his bounty
thus happily in the Hall of the Chosen, it was Donander’s
turn to shrug. Even had there been no other
discrepancies, everybody knew that heaven had, not
five hundred and forty golden gates, but only twelve
entrances, each carved from a single pearl and engraved
with the name of a tribe of Israel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Besides,” Donander asked, “who is this Weaver and
Constrainer? Certainly, I never heard of him before.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is the King and Father of the Ænseis,” they
told him. “He is overlord of that unimaginable folk
who dwell in Ydalir; and who do not kill their deformed
and weakling children, as we were used to do,
but instead cast from the ivory ramparts of Ydalir all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>such degenerate offspring, to be the gods of races who
are not blond and Nordic.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Donander, as a loyal son of the Church, could only
shake his head over such nonsense, and the innumerous
other errors by which these heathen were being
misled to everlasting ruin. Aloud, Donander repeated
his final verdict as to the pretensions of this Sidvrar,
by saying again, “I never heard of him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Nevertheless, Donander went without real discontent
among the pleasures of paradise, and he joined in all
the local sports. In common with the other dead, he
ate the flesh of the inexhaustible boar, and with them
he drank of the strong mead which sustained them in
perpetual tipsiness. And he sedately rode out with the
others every morning into the meadows where these
blessed pagan lords fought joyously among themselves
until midday. At noon a peal of thunder would sound,
the slain and wounded warriors were of a sudden revivified
and cured of their hurts, and were reunited to
whatsoever arms and heads and legs the contestants had
lost in their gaming: and the company would return
fraternally to the gold-roofed hall, where they ate and
drank and made their brags until they slept.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet perhaps our banquets might, messieurs,” Donander
had suggested, after a century or so of these
rough-and-ready pleasures, “be not unadvantageously
seasoned with the delights of feminine companionship,
if only for dessert?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>“But it is one of our appointed blessings to have
done with women and their silly ways,” cried out the
vikingar, “now that we have entered paradise.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Donander, who had always been notable for his
affectionate nature, and who had served vigorously so
many ladies par amours, seemed grieved to hear a saying
so unchivalrous. Still, he said nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus much time passed; and the worlds were
changed: but in the eyes of Donander of Évre, as in
the eyes of all who feasted in the Hall of the Chosen,
there was no knowledge nor any fear of time, because
these blessed dead lived now in perpetual tipsiness.
And, as befitted a loyal son of the Church, Donander,
without any complaining, in the surroundings which
Heaven out of Heaven’s wisdom had selected for him,
awaited the second coming of Manuel and the holy
Morrow of Judgment.</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>61.</i><br /><i>Vanadis, Dear Lady of Reginlief</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THEN, from the highest part of this paradise,
and from the unimaginable yew-vales of
Ydalir which rise above the topmost branches
of the tree called Lærath, descended blue-robed Vanadis,
the lady of Reginlief, dear to the Ænseis. She
had disposed of five inefficient husbands, in impetuous
mythological manners, but still a loneliness and a desire
was upon her; and with the eternal optimism of
widowhood she came to look for a sixth husband
among these great-thewed heroes who jeered at women
and their wiles.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Donander of Évre was the person who for two
reasons found instant favor in her eyes when she came
upon Donander refreshing himself after the pleasant
fatigues of that morning’s combat, and about his daily
bath in the shining waters of the river Gipul. So did
the dead call that stream which flowed from the antlers
of the monstrous stag who stood eternally nibbling
and munching above the Hall of the Chosen.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here is an eminently suitable person,” Vanadis reflected.
Aloud, she said, “Hail, friend! and does a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>stout fine fellow of your length and of your thickness
go languidly shunning work or seeking work?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Stalwart Donander climbed out of the clear stream
of Gipul. He came, smilingly and with a great exaltation,
toward the first woman whom he had seen in
seven hundred years. And, so constant is the nature
of woman, that divine Vanadis regarded Donander in
just the reflective wonder with which, more than seven
hundred years ago, barbarian Utsumé had looked at
Coth in the market-place of Porutsa.</p>

<p class='c005'>Donander said, “What is your meaning, madame?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vanadis replied, “I have a desire which, a fine portent
has informed me, agrees with your desire.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Vanadis, with god-like candor, made wholly
plain her meaning. And since Donander’s nature was
affectionate, he assented readily enough to the proposals
of this somewhat ardent but remarkably handsome
young woman, who went abroad thus unconventionally
in a car drawn by two cats, and who, in her heathenish
and figurative way, described herself as a goddess.
He stipulated only that, so soon as he was dressed,
they be respectably united according to whatever might
be the marriage laws of her country and diocese.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Ænseis were not used in such matters to stand
upon ceremony. Nevertheless, they conferred together,—Aduna
and Ord and Hleifner and Rönn and Giermivul,
and the other radiant sons of Sidvrar. It was
they who good-humoredly devised a ceremony, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>candles and promises and music and a gold ring, and
all the other features which seemed expected by the
quaint sort of husband whom their beloved Vanadis
had fetched up from the Hall of the Chosen. But
her sisters took no part in this ceremony, upon the
ground that they considered such public preliminaries
to be unheard-of and brazen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus was Donander made free of Ydalir, the land
that is above Lærath and all the other heavens and
paradises: and after Donander’s seven hundred years
of celibacy, he and his bride got on together in her
bright palace lovingly enough. Vanadis found that she
too, comparatively speaking, had lived with her five
earlier husbands in celibacy.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>
  <h2 class='c028'><i>62.</i><br /><i>The Demiurgy of Donander Veratyr</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the one change that Donander made an explicit
point of was to fit out in this palace of
Reginlief a chapel. There he worshiped daily
at the correct hours, so near as one could calculate
them in an endless day, and there he prayed for the
second coming of Manuel and for the welfare of Donander’s
soul upon the holy Morrow of Judgment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, really, my heart,” his Vanadis would say, ineffectually,
“you have been dead for so long now! And,
just looking at it sensibly, it does seem such a waste
of eternity!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have done, my darling, with your heathen nonsense!”
Donander would reply. “Do I not know that
in heaven there is no marrying or giving in marriage?
How then can heaven be this place in which two live
so friendlily and happily?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile, to the pagan priests wherever the Ænseis
were adored, had been revealed the sixth and the wholly
successful marriage of blue-robed Vanadis: her spouse
had been duly deified: and new temples had been builded
in honor of the bright lady of Reginlief and of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Man-God, Donander Veratyr, her tireless savior from
vain desire and bodily affliction. And time went
stealthily as a stream flowing about and over the worlds,
and changing them, and wearing all away. But to
Donander it was as if he yet lived in the thrice-lucky
afternoon on which he married his Vanadis. For, since
whatever any of the Ænseis desires must happen instantly,
thus Ydalir knows but one endless day; and
immeasurably beneath its radiance, very much as sullen
and rain-swollen waters go under a bridge upon which
young lovers have met in the sunlight of April, so
passed wholly unnoted by any in Ydalir the flowing and
all the jumbled wreckage of time.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it befell, too, after a great many of those æons
which Ydalir ignores and men cannot imagine, that
Donander saw one of his smaller brothers-in-law about
a droll looking sport. Donander asked questions: and
he learned this dark brisk little Koshchei was about a
game at which the younger Ænseis were used to play.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And how does one set about it?” Donander asked
then.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, thus and thus, my heart,” his wife replied.
Fond Vanadis was glad enough to find for him some
outdoor diversion which would woo him from that
stuffy chapel and its depressing pictures of tortured
persons and its unwholesome fogs of stifling incense.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Donander broke away a bough from the tree
called Lærath, saying meanwhile the proper word of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>power. Sitting beside the fifth river of Ydalir, he cut
strips of bark from this bough, with the green-handled
knife which Vanadis had given him, and he cast these
strips about at random. He found it perfectly true
that those scraps of barks which touched the water
became fish, those which he flung into the air became
birds, and those which fell upon the ground became animals
and men.</p>

<p class='c005'>He almost instantly, indeed, had enough creatures
to populate a world, but no world, of course, for them
to animate and diversify. So Donander destroyed
these creatures, and placed one of the lighter weirds
upon the beetle Karu. That huge good-tempered insect
fell at once to shaping a ball of mud, and to carving
it with mountains and plains and valleys. Then
Karu burrowed his way into the center of this ball of
mud: and from the hole into which Karu had entered
came all kinds of living beings needful for the animating
and diversifying of a world; and these began
to breed and to kill one another and to build their appropriate
lairs, in nests and dens and cities.</p>

<p class='c005'>This so excited another beetle, named Khypera, that
he behaved in a fashion not at all convenient to record;
but many living creatures were at once brought forth
by his remarkable conduct, and plants and creeping
things and men and women, too, came out of the tears
which Khypera let fall.</p>

<p class='c005'>That was the second demiurgy of Donander Veratyr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Then with a golden egg Donander made another world:
and from the entrails of a spider he drew another;
from the carrion of a dead cow he made a fifth world;
and with the aid of a raven Donander made yet one
more. Thereafter he went on, in turn attempting each
method that any Ans had ever practiced.</p>

<p class='c005'>These sports amused Donander for a long while and
yet another while. And Vanadis, apart from her natural
pleasure in the augmented vigor he got from so
much open-air exercise, bright Vanadis smiled at his
playing, in the way of any wife who finds her husband
occupied upon the whole less reprehensibly than you
would expect of the creature. And the sons of Sidvrar
also were used, as yet, to smile not unfriendlily
when they passed where Donander was busy with his
toys. Even the sisters of Vanadis only said that really
of all things, and that of course they had expected it
from the very first. Thus everybody was content for a
long while and yet another while.</p>

<p class='c005'>And throughout both these whiles Donander was pottering
with his worlds, keeping them bright with thunderbolts
and volcanic eruptions, diligently cleansing
them of parasites with one or another pestilence, scouring
them with whirlwinds, and perpetually washing
them with cloud-bursts and deluges. His toys had constantly
such loving care to keep them in perfect condition.
Meanwhile, his skill increased abreast with his
indulgence in demiurgy, and Donander thought of little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>else. He needed now no aid from ravens and beetles.
He had but, he found, to desire a world, and at
once his desire took form: its light was divided from
its darkness, the waters gathered into one place, the dry
land appeared and pullulated with living creatures, all
in one dexterous complacent moment of self-admiration.</p>

<p class='c005'>His earlier made stars and comets and suns and
asteroids Donander Veratyr began destroying one by
one, half vexedly, half in real amusement at the archaic,
bungling methods he had outgrown. In their places he
would set spinning, and glittering, and popping, quite
other planetary systems which, for the moment in any
event, appeared to him remarkably adroit craftsmanship.
And everywhere upon the worlds which he had
made, and had not yet annihilated, men worshiped Donander
Veratyr: and in his pleasant home at Reginlief,
high over Lærath and every other heaven and paradise,
Donander worshiped the god of the fathers and
of all the reputable neighbors of Donander of Évre;
and in such pagan surroundings as Heaven out of
Heaven’s wisdom had selected for him, awaited the
second coming of Manuel and the holy Morrow of
Judgment.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THEN of a sudden gleaming Sidvrar Vafudir,
the Weaver and Constrainer, came with his
wolves frisking about him. He came with his
broad-brimmed hat pulled down about his eyes decisively.
He came thus to his daughter, blue-robed
Vanadis, and he stated that, while patience was a virtue,
there was such a thing as overdoing it, no matter
how little he himself might care for the talking of idle
busybodies, because, however long she might argue, and
always had done from childhood, being in this and in
many other undesirable respects precisely like her
mother, even so, no sensible Ans could ever deny her
husband’s conduct was ridiculous: and that, said Sidvrar
Vafudir, was all there was to it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do not bluster so, my heart,” replied Vanadis,
“about the facts of nature. All husbands are ridiculous.
Who should be surer of this than I, who have
had six husbands, unless it be you, who as goat and
titmouse and birch tree have been the husband of six
hundred?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is all very well,” said Sidvrar, “in addition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>to not being what we were discussing. This Donander
of yours is now one of the Ænseis, he is an Ans of
mature standing, and it is not right for him to be making
worlds. That is what we were discussing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet what divine hands anywhere,” asked Vanadis,
“are clean of demiurgy?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is not what we were discussing, either. When
you brats of mine were children you had your toys, and
you played with and you smashed your toys. Nobody
denies that, because you all did, from Rönn to Aduna,
and even little Koshchei used to be having his fling at
such nonsense. Now do you look at the very fine and
sober fellow he is, with all his pranks behind him, and
do you ask Koshchei what he thinks of that husband of
yours! But instead, you prefer to wander away from
what we were discussing, because you know as well as
I do that for children to be playing at such games is
natural enough, besides keeping the young out of grave
mischief, now and then. Though, to be sure, nothing
does that very long nor very often, as I tell you plainly,
my Vanadis, for do you look, too, as a most grievous
example, at the wasteful and untidy way you destroy
your husbands!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Donander Veratyr I shall not ever destroy,” replied
Vanadis, smiling, “because of the loving human
heart and the maddening human ways he has brought
out of his Poictesme, and for two other reasons.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then it is I who will put an end, if not to him, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>least to his nonsense. For this Donander of yours is
still playing with stars and planets, and setting off his
comets, and exploding his suns, and that is not becoming.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, well, do you, who are the Father and Master
of All, have your own will with him, so far as you can
get it,” Vanadis returned, still with that rather reminiscent
smile. She had now lived for a great while
with this sixth husband of hers, who had a human
heart in him and human ways.</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>64.</i><br /><i>Through the Oval Window</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>SIDVRAR went then from Vanadis to Donander.
But the Constrainer found there was no instant
manner of constraining Donander Veratyr into
a conviction that Donander of Évre had died long ago,
and had become an Ans. People, Donander stated, did
not do such things; when people died they went either
to heaven or to hell: and further reasoning with Donander
seemed to accomplish no good whatever. For
Donander, as a loyal son of the Church, now shrugged
pityingly at the heathen nonsense talked by his father-in-law.
He stroked the heads of Sidvrar’s attendant
wolves, he listened to the Weaver and Constrainer with
an indulgence more properly reserved for the feeble-minded;
and he said, a little relishingly, that Messire
Sidvrar would be wiser on the holy Morrow of Judgment.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Sidvrar Vafudir became Sidvrar Yggr, the
Meditating and Terrible. Then Sidvrar fell about
such magicking as he had not needed to use since he
first entered into the eternal yew-vales of Ydalir.
Then, in a word, Sidvrar unclosed the oval window in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Reginlief that opened upon space and time and upon
the frozen cinders which once had been worlds and suns
and stars, and which their various creators had annihilated,
as one by one the Ænseis had put away their
childhood and its playing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among such wreckage sped pretentiously the yet living
worlds which Donander had made. These toys,
when seen thus closely through the magic of the oval
window, were abristle with the spires of the temples
and the cathedrals in which they that lived, as yet,
upon these worlds were used to worship. In all these
churches men invoked Donander Veratyr. Through
that charmed window now, for the first time, came to
his ears the outcry of his clergy and laity: nowhere
was there talk of another god, not even where from
many worlds arose the lecturing of those who explained
away their ancestors’ quaint notions about Donander
the Man-God, the Savior from Vain Desire,
the Preserver from Bodily Affliction, and proved there
could not be any such person. And to Donander, looking
out of the window at Reginlief, all these things
showed as a swarming of ants or as a writhing of very
small maggots about the worlds which he had made to
divert him: and in the face as in the heart of Donander
awoke inquietation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If this be a true showing,” Donander said, by and
by, “show now that Earth which is my home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>After a while of searching, Sidvrar found for him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>the drifting clinker which had once been Earth. Upon
its glistering nakedness was left no living plant nor any
breathing creature, for the Morrow of Judgment was
long past, and Earth’s affairs had been wound up.
Upon no planet did any one remember the god whom
Donander worshiped, now that Jahveh had ended playing,
and his toys were broken or put away. Upon
many planets were the temples of Donander Veratyr,
and the rising smoke of his sacrifice, and the cries of
his worshipers as they murdered one another in their
disputing over points of theology which Donander
could not clearly understand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nor did he think about these things. Instead, Donander
Veratyr, who was the last of the Ænseis to
play at this unprofitable sport of demiurgy, was now
remembering the days and the moon-lighted nights of
his youth, and the dear trivial persons whom he had
then loved and revered. He did not think about the
two wives whom he had married upon Earth, nor about
his son Maugis, nor about any of the happenings of
Donander’s manhood. He thought of, for no reason
at all, the shabby little village priest who had confirmed
him, and of the father and mother who had been
all-wise and able to defend one from every evil, and
of the tall girl whose lips had, once, and before any
other lips, been sweeter than were the joys of Ydalir.
And he thought of many other futile things, all now
attested always to have been futile, which long ago had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>seemed so very important to the boy that, in serving
famous Manuel of Poictesme, had postured so high-heartedly
in one of the smallest provinces of an extinct
planet.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Donander wrung immortal hands, saying, “If
this be a true showing, what thing have I become, who
can no longer love or reverence anything! who can have
no care for any Morrow of Judgment! and to whom
space reveals only the living of these indistinguishable
and unclean and demented insects!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The cry of his worshipers came up to him. “Thou
art God, the Creator and Preserver of all us Thy children!
Thou art Donander Veratyr, in Whom is our
firm hope! Thou art the Man-God, That wilt grant
unto us justice and salvation upon the holy Morrow
of Judgment!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it,” Donander said, “of Manuel that these little
creatures speak?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We know not of any Manuel,” the universe replied
to him. “We only know that Thou art God, our
Creator and Preserver.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, after viewing again the vermin which swarmed
about his worlds, Donander said, like one a little frightened,
“Is God thus?”</p>

<p class='c005'>They answered him, fondly and reverently, “How
can God be otherwise than Thou art?”</p>

<p class='c005'>At that Donander shuddered. But in the same moment
he said, “If this be a true showing, and if I be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>indeed a god, and the master of all things, the human
heart which survives in me wills now to create that
to-morrow for which these weaklings and I too have
so long waited.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Sidvrar pointed out, as patiently as outraged
common-sense permitted: “Still, still, you are talking
nonsense! How can an Ans create to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Donander asked, in turn, “Why not, if you be omnipotent?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is because we are omnipotent. Thus in Ydalir
there is but one day, from which not even in imagination
can any Ans escape. For, whatever any of the
Ænseis desires, even if it be a to-morrow, must instantly
happen and exist; and so must be to-day. That
ought to be plain enough.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is not plain,” Donander answered, “although, the
way you put it, I admit, it does sound logical. Therefore,
if this indeed be the way of omnipotence, and if
none may escape his day, and if I be a trapped and
meager immortal, and the master only of those things
which are to-day, then now let all things end! For
my heart stays human. To-day does not know the
runes of my heart’s contentment. My heart will not
be satisfied unless it enter into that morrow of justice
and salvation which the overlords of men, as you now
tell me, cannot desire nor plan. So now, if this be a
true showing, now let all things end!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Within the moment Donander saw that, while he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>was yet speaking, space was emptied of life. Down
yonder now were no more men and women anywhere.
None any longer awaited an oncoming day which was
to content one utterly with an assured bright heritage,
divined in the dreams which allured and derided all
human living endlessly, and condemned the heart of
every man to be a stranger to contentment upon this
side of to-morrow. That ageless dream about to-morrow,
and about the redeeming which was to come—to-morrow—had
passed, as the smoke of a little incense
passes; and with it had gone out of being, too, those
whom it had nourished and sustained. There were no
more men or women anywhere. Donander could see
only many cinders adrift in a bleak loneliness: and
Donander of Évre must endure eternally as Donander
Veratyr, a lonely and uncomprehended immortal,
among his many peers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So do you be sensible about it, my son-in-law,”
said Sidvrar Vafudir, when he had spoken the word of
power which closed forever that cheerless window, out
of which nobody was ever to look any more,—“be
sensible if there indeed stay any root of intelligence
in you. And do you henceforward live more fittingly,
as a credit to your wife’s family. And do you put
out of mind those cinders and those ashes and those
clinkers that were the proper sport of your youth.
Such is the end of every wise person’s saga.”</p>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>THEREAFTER the King and Father of the
Ænseis departed, well pleased with the lesson
taught that whippersnapper. And Donander
also smiled, and he looked contentedly about his pleasant
quarters in the everlasting vales of Ydalir.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Still, not for a great deal,” Donander reflected,
“would I be treading in that old sorcerer’s sandals;
and it is a fair shame that I should have such a person
for a father-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For, as a loyal son of the Church, Donander did not
doubt that the wonders which Sidvrar had just shown
to him could only be an illusion planned with some evil
spirit’s aid to tempt Donander away from respectability
and the true faith. In consequence Donander Veratyr,
that had been the Creator and Destroyer of all
things except the human heart which survived in him,
went now into the chapel of Reginlief. There he
decorously said the prayers to which Donander was
accustomed, and he prayed for the second coming of
Manuel and for the welfare of Donander’s soul upon
the holy Morrow of Judgment.</p>

  <h2 class='c028'><i>66.</i><br /><i>Old Age of Niafer</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the tale is of crippled old Dame Niafer,
who had reformed the Poictesme which her
husband redeemed, and of the thinking which
came upon her in the last days of her life. Until latterly
Niafer had not, with at every turn so many
things requiring to be done, had very much time for
thinking. But now there was nothing more ever to
be done by Madame Niafer. Radegonde saw to that.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gray-eyed minx ruled everything and everybody.
That was not pleasant for her mother-in-law
to behold, after Niafer herself had ruled over Poictesme
for some twenty years, and all the while had
kept frivolity and disorder out of fashion. No mother
could, in the first place, honestly enjoy seeing her own
son thus hoodwinked and led into perpetual dissipation
at all hours of the night, by a wife who, at thirteen
hundred and some years of age, might reasonably be
expected to know better. In the second place, Niafer
could have managed things, and very certainly poor
Emmerick, with immeasurably more benefit to everybody,
and to common-sense too.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>All that warring with Maugis, for instance, had
been a sad mistake. Now, under my regency, the aged
Countess would reflect with complacence, there was
grumbling here and there,—men being what they are,
with no least idea as to what is actually good for them,—but
never any armed revolt. When people were dissatisfied,
you sent for them, they came, you had a
sensible talk, you found out what was really wrong,
and you righted matters to the utmost extent that such
a righting seemed judicious; you eked out the remainder
with a little harmless soft-soaping, and that was
all there was to it. No warrior in his sane senses would
go to war with an intelligent old lady who esteemed
him such a particularly fine fellow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, if at the very beginning, that poor Maugis—quite
a nice-looking child, too, until he lost flesh under
that continual plotting and throat-cutting, with parents
you had known for years,—had been had in to dinner,
just with the family, then all that killing and burning
and being awakened at unearthly hours by the misguided
boy’s night attacks upon Bellegarde would have
been avoided.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Niafer, of course, had been allowed no say in
the matter. She was allowed no say in any matter by
that woman, who topped off her ill-doing by being always
so insufferably pleasant and so considerate of
Mother Niafer’s comfort. And in this enforced idleness
it was rather lonely now that Holmendis was dead.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Nearly seven years ago now that dependable and always
firm friend had gone crusading with St. Louis;
and the pair of them had passed from the ruins of
Carthage to eternal glory with the aid of dysentery.
Niafer missed Holmendis a great deal, after the three
decades of close friendship and of the continuous
intimacy about which people said things of which
the old Countess was aware enough and utterly indifferent.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had her children, of course. It was particularly
nice to have Melicent back again, after all these years
of never quite really knowing whether the child was
managing her abductor tactfully, in that far-off Nacumera.
But the children had their own children now,
and their own affairs; and none of these possessions
were they inclined to let Niafer control, in the Poictesme
wherein, for eighteen years, she had controlled
everything. For the rest, Dame Niafer knew that a
prophecy which had been made to her very long ago
by the Head of Misery was now being fulfilled: she
had no place in the world’s ordering, she was but a
tolerated intruder into her children’s living, and nobody
anywhere did more than condone her coming.</p>

<p class='c005'>Niafer did not blame her children. She instead admitted,
with the vast practicality not ever to be comprehended
by any male creature, that their behavior
was sensible.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I would meddle perpetually if they permitted it. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>am very often a nuisance, as it is. And so, that part
of the prophecy about my weeping in secret is quite
plainly nonsense, since there is nothing whatever to
weep about, or even to be surprised at,” Dame Niafer
stated cheerily.</p>

<p class='c005'>And so, too, if sometimes, after one or another
crossing of her still pertinacious will, the dethroned
old ruler of Poictesme would hobble very quietly into
her own rooms, and would remain there for a lengthy
while with the door locked, and would come out by
and by with reddened eyes, nobody noticed it particularly.
For she, who in her prime had been the most
sociable of potentates, seemed nowadays to prefer upon
the whole to be alone. She was continually, without
any ostentation, limping away from any little gathering
of her descendants. Mother was becoming slightly
queer: you shrugged, not at all unfondly, over the fact,
and put up with it. Grandmother would be there one
moment laughing and talking like everybody else; and
the very next moment she was gone. And you would
find her, accidentally, in some quiet corner quite alone,
bent up a little, and not doing anything whatever, but
just thinking....</p>

<p class='c005'>Dame Niafer thought, usually, about her husband.
Her lot had been the most glorious among the lots of
all women in that she had been Manuel’s wife. That
marvelous five years of living which she had shared
with Manuel the Redeemer was not an extensive section
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>of her life, but it was the one part which really counted,
she supposed. It was only on account of her human
frailty that she remembered so many more things about
Holmendis, who was a mere saint, than she did about
her Manuel. She found it, nowadays, rather hard—and
injudicious, too,—to recall any quite definite details
about her miraculous husband: there was only, at a
comfortable remoteness, a tall gray god in a great
golden glowing. It was all wonderful, and inspiring,
and very sad, too, but noticeably vague: and the
tears which came into your eyes were pleasant, without
your knowing exactly what you were crying
about.</p>

<p class='c005'>That was the best way in which to think of her
Manuel. A prying into particulars, a dwelling upon
any detail whatever, was injudicious. Such a perhaps
blasphemous direction of your thoughts suggested, for
instance, that matters were going to be a trifle awkward,
just at first, after that second coming of the
Redeemer.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not, altogether, that Manuel would be a
stranger to her, nor even that omniscience, of course,
knew all about Holmendis. In dealing with a liberal
patron of the Church it was the métier of omniscience
to become a little myopic. For that matter, Dom
Manuel’s earthly past was not so far gone out of his
wife’s memory that he could be the only person to do
any talking about natural frailties. No, the drawback
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>would be, rather, that, when her Manuel had returned,
in undiminished glory, you would have to get accustomed
to so many things, all over again.... Niafer
hoped that, in any event, at his second coming he would
not bring back with him that irritating habit of catching
cold on every least occasion: for you probably could
not with decency rebuke a spiritual Redeemer for his
insistence upon keeping the rooms stuffy and shut up
everywhere on account of the draughts, any more than
you could really look up to him with appropriate reverence
if he came snorting and sneezing all over the place....
And if he for one single solitary moment expected
to have, in his reordering of human affairs, that
Alianora and that Freydis of his established anywhere
near his lawful wife....</p>

<p class='c005'>That mad contingency, however, was not at any
time mentally provided against, because at this point
Niafer would turn away from this undoubtedly blasphemous
trend of speculation. Her Manuel was in all
things perfect. He would come again in unimaginable
glory, and he would exalt her, his chosen, his one bride,
who was so utterly unworthy of him, to the sharing
of an eternal felicity which—after you got accustomed
to it, and really settled down, with a fresh growth of
hair and a complete set of teeth and all the other perquisites
of unfading youth,—would be quite pleasant.
Details could wait. Details, the moment you dwelt
upon them, became upsetting. Details in any way relative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>to those hussies were no doubt directly suggested
by the powers of evil.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was after such considerations that Niafer would
go to pray beside the tomb which she had builded in
honor of Manuel.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>NOW the tale tells that in the spring of the year
old Niafer, thus sitting beside her husband’s
tomb, looked up and found another aged woman
waiting near her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hail, Queen of England!” said Dame Niafer, with
quite as much civility as there was any need for.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So!” said the other. “You would be his wife. Yes.
I remember you, that day near Wissant. But how
could you be recognizing me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are there not tears in your old eyes? There is no
other person living, since that double-faced Freydis got
her just deserts,” replied Niafer, very quietly, “who
would be shedding tears over my Manuel’s tomb. We
two alone remember him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is true,” said Alianora. And for no reason
at all she smiled a little. “One hears so much about
him, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The world has learned to appreciate my husband,”
Niafer assented. She did not altogether approve of
Madame Alianora’s smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the Queen said: “He was rather a dear boy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>And I am not denying that I cared a great deal about
him once. But even so, my dear, this wonder of the
world that the poems and the histories are about, and
that the statues and the shrines commemorate, and that
one, in mere decency, has to pretend to remember!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sure I do not at all understand you, Madame
Alianora.” And Niafer looked without any love at
this Queen of England who in the old days had been
upon terms of such regrettable intimacy with Dom
Manuel.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Alianora went on, with that provokingly pleasant
air of hers: “No, you would not understand the
joke of it. You do not properly value the work of
your hands and of your imagining. But this legend
which you in chief, with the pride and the foolishness
of Poictesme to back you, have been quietly and so
tirelessly fostering through all these years, has spread
through the known world. Our Manuel has become
the peer of Hector and of Arthur and of Charlemagne
for his bravery and his wisdom and his other perfections.
Our Manuel is to come again, in all his former
glory! And I, who remember Manuel quite clearly—though
I am not denying he has had his successors in
my good will and friendly interest,—well, in perfect
candor, my dear, I find these notions rather droll.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To this sort of talking Niafer replied, sharply
enough, “I do not know of any reason in the world for
you to be speaking of my husband as ‘our’ Manuel.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“No, my dear, I am sure he took excellent care that
you should never know about such things. Well, but
all that is over a great while ago. And there is no
need for us two to be quarreling over the lad that took
his pleasure with the pair of us, and with Queen Freydis
too, and with nobody knows how many other
women, and who, to do him justice, gave to each playfellow
a fair half of that pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This exposed unvenerable handsome old Alianora to
the gaze of perturbed decorum. “I do not think,
madame, that you ought to be alluding to such frivolous
matters here at his tomb.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“After all, though,” Alianora stated, “it is not as if
he were really buried in this place. You dreaming
braggarts of Poictesme had not even a corpse to start
with, when you began on your fine legend. No: the
entire affair is pure invention; and is very neatly symbolized
by this stately tomb with nothing whatever inside
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What, though, if Manuel had been truly buried
here, what would this world have been relinquishing to
the cold grave?” said Freydis. For Niafer saw that
Freydis also was at hand. This Freydis was a witch
woman with whose connivance Dom Manuel had in
the old days made unholy images and considerable
scandal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nobody knows that,” continued Freydis. “Not
even we who, as we said, loved Manuel the Redeemer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>in his mortal life knew anything about Manuel. What
sort of being lived inside that squinting tall strong husk
which used to fondle us? I often wonder about
that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear creature,” said Alianora, “do you really
think it particularly matters? I am sure we never used
to think about that especial question at the time, because
the husk was, in all conscience, enough to deal
with. Yes, you may say what you will about Manuel,
but among friends there is no harm in conceding that in
some respects we three know him to have been quite
wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was then that the old Queen of England looked
up toward the gleaming statue of the man whom these
three women had loved variously. Manuel towered
high above them, bedazzling in the May sunlight, serene,
eternally heroic, eternally in that prime of life
which his put-by spent bedfellows had long ago overpassed;
and he seemed to regard exalted matters ineffably
beyond the scope of their mortal living and the
comprehension of frail human faculties. But wrinkled
jovial Alianora smiled up at this superb Redeemer
fondly and just a little mockingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You understood me,” Alianora said, “and I you.
But we did not talk about it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I say that nobody understood Manuel,” replied
Freydis. “I say it is a strange thing that we three
should be continuing the life of Manuel and the true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>nature of the being who lived inside that husk, and
that we three should yet stay ignorant of what we are
giving to the times that are to come. For Manuel has
already returned, and he will keep returning again and
yet again, without redeeming anything and without
there being any wonder about it—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Alianora was interested. “But do you explain, my
darling—!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dead Manuel lives again in your tall squinting
son—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,—and do you just imagine, Freydis dear, what
a reflection that is to any mother, what with Manuel’s
irregular notions about marriage—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“—And in the four children that he had by Niafer,”
Freydis continued. “And in these children’s children
our Manuel’s life will be renewed, and after that in
their grandchildren: and Manuel’s life and Manuel’s
true nature will thus go on, in many bodies, so long
as men act foolishly by day and wickedly at night.
And in the images which I aided him to make and to
inform with fire from Audela, in these also, when
these are set to live as men among mankind,—and, to
my fancy, no more reasonably than my two elder children,
Sesphra and Raimbaut, have lived already,—in
these also, will our Manuel live.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I see,” said Alianora: “and your explanation of
his second and of, indeed, his two thousandth coming
seems to me, I confess, much the more plausible. Yes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>I see. Manuel has already returned; and he will return
again any number of times—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Freydis said moodily, “And to whose benefit and
pleasuring?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My darling Freydis! You may depend upon it
that on each occasion two persons will get a great deal
of pleasure out of preparing the way for him. And
that,” said Alianora, “that and whatever else may befall
those persons who have Manuel’s proclivities and
life in them will be but another happening in the
Biography of Manuel. We three have begun a neverending
set of comedies in which the life of Manuel
will be the main actor. We have, as one might say,—among
friends, my darlings,—collaborated with the
dear boy to make an endless series of Manuels, without
any special reassurance that to do this was going
to give good and pleasure to anybody except—say what
you will, my dears,—it does always give to a hearty
young woman. For we do not know, even now, exactly
what sort of a creature this Manuel was and,
thanks to our collaboration, will continue to be. Yes,
now I see your point, my dear Freydis; and it is really
a curious one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again, though, Alianora smiled up toward the statue
of Manuel as though there were some secret between
them. And Niafer had no patience whatever with the
leering and iniquitous old hussy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The whole world knows,” said Niafer, indignantly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>“what sort of person my husband was, for my Manuel
is famous throughout Christendom.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” Alianora assented, “he is famous as a paragon
of all the Christian virtues, and as the Redeemer
whose return is to restore the happiness and glories of
his people: and it is upon that joke, my dear Niafer,
I was congratulating you a moment or two ago.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is famous for his loyalty and valor and wisdom,”
said Freydis. “I hear of it. And I remember
the tall frightened fool who betrayed me, and whom
at the last I spared out of mere pity for his worthlessness.
And still, I spare and I perpetuate and I foster
his living, in my children, because it is certain that a
woman’s folly does not ever perish.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nevertheless, I know how to avail myself of a
woman’s folly,” said Horvendile,—for now, Dame
Niafer perceived, that queer, red-headed Horvendile
also was standing beside her husband’s tomb,—“and
of the babble of children, and of the unwillingness of
men to face the universe with no better backing than
their own resources.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Horvendile looked full at Niafer, with his
young, rather cruel smile. And Horvendile said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“So does it come about that the saga of Manuel and
the sagas of all the lords of the Silver Stallion have
been reshaped by the foolishness and the fond optimism
of mankind; and these sagas now conform in
everything to that supreme romance which preserves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>us from insanity. For it is just as I said, years ago,
to one of these so drolly whitewashed and ennobled
rapscallions. All men that live, and that go perforce
about this world like blundering lost children whose
rescuer is not yet in sight, have a vital need to believe
in this sustaining legend about the Redeemer, and
about the Redeemer’s power to make those persons who
serve him just and perfect.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is you who are much worse than a rapscallion!”
cried out Dame Niafer. “You are as bad as these
women here. But I will not listen to any of you or
to any more of your jealous and foul blasphemies—!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Madame Niafer awakened, to find herself alone
by the great tomb. But real footsteps were approaching,
and they proved to be those of a person rather
more acceptable to her than was that jeering Horvendile
or were those brazen-faced and thoroughly vile-minded
women about whom Dame Niafer had been
dreaming.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>FOR at this point Madame Niafer was approached
by Jurgen, the son of Coth, who came to Manuel’s
tomb upon a slight professional matter.
Jurgen—now some while reformed by the ruthless impairments
of middle age, and settled down into tempestuous
matrimony with the daughter of Ninzian (by
the wife of well-to-do old Pettipas),—had since his
marriage brought new life and fresh connections into
the business of his nominal father-in-law; and was
to-day the leading pawnbroker of Poictesme. It was
thus to Jurgen, naturally enough, that Count Emmerick’s
wife, Radegonde, had applied in these hard
times which followed the long and impoverishing war
with Maugis d’Aigremont.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Countess had been taking of Dom Manuel’s
tomb what she described as a really practical view.
The tomb was magnificent and in every way a credit
to the great hero’s family. Still, as Radegonde pointed
out to her husband, that effigy of Manuel at the top
was inset with scores of handsome gems which were
virtually being wasted. If—of course without giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>any vulgar publicity to the improvement—these jewels
could be replaced with bits of suitably colored glass,
the visual effect would remain the same, the tomb would
be as handsome as ever, and nobody would be the wiser
excepting only Count Emmerick and Radegonde, who
would also be by a deal the wealthier.</p>

<p class='c005'>Emmerick had replied, with appropriate indignation,
that it would be blasphemy thus to despoil the tomb of
his heroic father.</p>

<p class='c005'>But to the contrary, it was Emmerick, as he forthwith
learned, who blasphemed his heroic father’s memory
in even for one moment supposing that the blessed
dead cared about such vanities as rubies and sapphires,
and wanted their own innocent grandchildren to starve
in the gutter; and, for the rest, would he simply look
at that pile of bills, and not be driving everybody
crazy with his high-and-mighty nonsense.</p>

<p class='c005'>Emmerick did look, very briefly and with unhidden
aversion, toward the candid smallish mountain of unsettled
accounts with which he was already but too
familiar. “Nevertheless,” said Emmerick, “it would
be an abominable action, if the story were ever to get
out—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It will not get out, my dear,” replied his wife,
“for we will leave the whole matter to Jurgen, who is
the soul of discretion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“—And I cannot afford to have any part in it,”
said Emmerick, virtuously.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>“You need take no part whatever,” his wife assured
him, “but only your fair half of the proceeds.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So Radegonde sent for Jurgen the pawnbroker, and
asked him to appraise the jewels in Dom Manuel’s effigy,
and to name his best price for them.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was thus that Jurgen happened to come just then
to Manuel’s tomb and to disturb the dreaming of
Madame Niafer.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>══════════════════════════════════════════════════</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>“YOU,” the fluttered old lady began—oddly
enough, it must have seemed to Jurgen,—“you
were the last of living persons to lay
eyes upon him. It is very strange that you of all
people should come now to end my dreaming. I take
your coming, rogue, as an omen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Madame Niafer began to tell him somewhat of
her dream. And Jurgen listened, with the patience
and the fondness which the plight of very old persons
always seemed to evoke in him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jurgen was upon excellent terms with Madame
Niafer, whom, for Biblical reasons, he was accustomed
to refer to as the Centurion. “You say to one man,
Go, and he goeth; and you say to another man,
Come, and he cometh,” Jurgen explained. “In fine,
you are a most terrible person. But when you say to
me, Go, I do not obey you, madame, because you are
also a dear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Niafer regarded this as sheer impudence, and vastly
liked it.</p>

<p class='c005'>So she told him about her dream.... And it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>possible, Dame Niafer now admitted, that this dream
might have a little misrepresented the deplorable women
involved, because that snaky-eyed Freydis was known,
since she got her dues from the Druids and the satirists,
to be satisfactorily imprisoned in infamous Antan,
whereas that hypocrite of an Alianora was now a nun
at Ambresbury. But in Madame Niafer’s dreaming
the hussies had seemed equally free from the constraint
of infamy and of the convent: they had seemed to be
far more dreadfully constrained, by skepticism....</p>

<p class='c005'>“Madame,” said Jurgen, at the end of her account,
“what need is there, after all, to worry over this little
day-dream? I myself had but last month, upon Walburga’s
Eve, a far more extensive and disturbing
dream: and nothing whatever came of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Countess answered: “I grow old; and with age
one is less certain of everything. Oh, I know well
enough that the lewd smirking hussies were very slanderously
in the wrong! Still, Jurgen, still, dear rogue,
there is a haunting whisper which tells me that time
means to take all away. I am a lonely powerless old
creature now, but I stay Manuel’s wife. That alone
had remained to me, to have been the one love and the
proud wife of the great Redeemer of Poictesme. Now,
at the last, a whispering tells me, time must take away
that also. My Manuel, a whispering tells me, was no
more splendid than other men, he performed no prodigies,
and there will be no second coming of the Redeemer:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>a whispering tells me that I knew this always
and that all these years I have been acting out a
lie. I think that whispering talks nonsense. And yet,
with age, Jurgen, with age and in the waiting loneliness
of age, one grows less certain of everything.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Madame,” said Jurgen, with his most judicial
aspect, “let us regard this really very interesting question
from its worst possible side. Let us—with suitable
apologies to his great shade, and merely for the
quicker confounding of his aspersers,—suppose that
Dom Manuel was, in point of fact, not anything remarkable.
Let us wildly imagine the cult of the Redeemer
which now is spread all over our land, to be
compact of exaggeration and misunderstanding and to
be based virtually upon nothing. The fact remains
that this heroic and gentle and perfect Redeemer,
whether or no he ever actually existed, is now honored
and, within reason and within the reach of human
frailty, is emulated everywhere, at least now and then.
His perfection has thus far, I grant you, proved un-contagious:
he has made nobody anywhere absolutely
immaculate: but none the less,—within limits, within
the unavoidable limits,—men are quite appreciably better
because of this Manuel’s example and teachings—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Men are happier also, Jurgen, because of that prediction
as to his second coming which he uttered in
your presence on the last night of his living, and which
you brought down from Morven.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>Jurgen coughed. “It is a pleasure, it is always a
pleasure, to further in any way the well-being of my
fellow-creatures. But—to resume the immediate
thread of my argument,—if this superb and most beneficial
example was not ever actually set by Dom Manuel—owing
to the press of family and state affairs,—if
this example were, indeed, wholly your personal invention,
then you, O terrible Centurion, would be one
of the most potent creative artists who ever lived. Now
that I proclaim, as a retired poet, to be a possibility
from which you should not take shame, but only pride
and thankfulness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you not be talking your wheedling nonsense to
me, young fellow! For, if my life had been given over
to the spreading of romances about a Manuel who never
lived—!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her weak, old, shriveled hands were fluttering before
her, helplessly, in a kind of futile wildness. She
clasped them now, so that each hand seemed to restrain
the other. And Jurgen answered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I quail. I am appropriately terrified by your snappishness,
and flattered by your choice of an adjective.
I venture, none the less, to observe that I have encountered,
Centurion dear, in the writings of one or another
learned author, whose name at the present escapes me,
the striking statement, and the wholly true statement,—and
a statement which was, indeed, a favorite with my
saintly father,—that a tree may always be judged by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>its fruit. Now, the children of Dom Manuel have thus
far most emphatically borne out this statement. Count
Emmerick”—here Jurgen coughed,—“Count Emmerick
is noted for his hospitality—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Emmerick,” said Dame Niafer, “would be well
enough if he were not led by the nose in everything
by that wife of his.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Jurgen’s shoulders went up, his hands went
outward, to disclaim any personal share in the old
lady’s appraisement of his present client Radegonde.
But Jurgen did not argue the matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Madame Melicent,” Jurgen equably resumed, “has
been the provoker of much gratifyingly destructive
warfare oversea, just as Madame Ettarre has been the
cause of another long war here at home, in which many
gentlemen have won large honor, and hundreds of the
humbler sort have been enabled to enter into a degree
of eternal bliss appropriate to their inferior estate.
Such wars evoke the noble emotions of patriotism, they
enable people to become proficient in self-sacrifice, and
they remarkably better business conditions, as my
ledgers attest. As for Madame Dorothy, while she has
incited no glorious public homicides and arsons, she
has gratified and she has made more pleasurable the
existence of half the gentry of Poictesme—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what, you rogue, do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I allude to the organ of vision, without any anatomical
excursus. I mean that to behold such perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>beauty makes life more pleasurable. Moreover,
Madame Dorothy has incited a fine poem and a hungering
and a dreaming that will not die, and a laughter
which derides its utterer, too pitilessly—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Jurgen’s voice had altered so that the old lady
looked at him more narrowly. Niafer had an excellent
memory. She perfectly recalled the infatuation
of Jurgen’s youth, she who had no delusions about
this daughter of hers. And Niafer reflected briefly
upon the incurable romanticism of all men.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Niafer said only, “I never heard of any such
poem.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jurgen now completed the third of those convenient
coughing spells. “I refer to an epic which stays as yet
unpublished. It is a variation upon the Grail legend,
madame, and pertains to the quest of a somewhat different
receptacle. However! In regard to the other
children of Dom Manuel,—concerning whose mothers
your opinions, my adored Centurion, do equal credit
to your sturdy morality and your skill in the art of
impassioned prose,—we have Messire Raimbaut, a very
notably respected poet, we have Sesphra, who has become
a god of the Philistines. Poets befall all
families, of course, with nobody to blame, whereas a
god, madame, is not ever, as rhetoricians express it,
to be sneezed at. We have, moreover, Edward Longshanks,
one of the most applauded monarchs that England
has ever known, because he so compactly exhibits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>in his large person every one of the general defects and
limitations of his people. Thus far, madame, we may
estimate the children of Dom Manuel’s body to have
made a rather creditable showing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is something in what you say,” Dame Niafer
admitted. “Yet what is this nonsense about ‘the children
of his body’? Have men any other implement,
unknown to their wives, with which to beget children?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jurgen beamed. Jurgen, it was apparent, had found
an enticing idea to play with.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is quite another sort of paternity, acquired
without the need of troubling and upsetting any woman.
So, for the perfect rounding off of our argument, we
must consider also Dom Manuel’s children in the spirit,
those lords who were of the Fellowship of the Silver
Stallion, and whose heroism was modeled so exactly
after his fine example.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Niafer replied, a little puzzled: “They were notable
and pious persons, who were sent into all parts of the
earth as the apostles of the Redeemer, and who will
return again with Manuel.... But do you tell me
just what you mean!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean that it was of rough and ungodly fighting-men
that Dom Manuel’s example made these incomparable
heroes. There was a time, madame,—a time
to which we may now, in the proper spirit, refer without
any impiety,—when their delight in battle was as
vigorous as their moral principles were lax, a time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>when they jested at holy things, and when their chastity
was defective.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Countess nodded. “I remember that time. It
was an evil time, with no respectability in it: and I
said so, from the first.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet do you consider what Dom Manuel’s example
and teachings made, in the end, of his companions in
this life! Do you consider the saintly deeds of Holden
and of Anavalt, and how Ninzian was for so long
the mainstay of all religion hereabouts—!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ninzian was a holy person, and even among the
apostles of Manuel he was perhaps the most devout.
Nevertheless—”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Jurgen now became more particular. “Do you
consider how but fourteen years ago Donander died a
martyr in conflict with the pagan Northmen, proving
with his body’s loss the falsity and wickedness of their
superstitions when in the sight of both armies Donander
was raised up into heaven by seven angels in the
same instant that a devil carried his adversary northward!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That miracle is attested. Yet—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Consider how holy Gonfal also perished as a martyr
among the infidels of Inis Dahut, after his chaste
resistance to the improper advances of their queen!
There, madame, was a very soul-stirring example for
you, because you brunettes are not easy to resist.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get along with you, you rogue! My eyes stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>dark and keen enough to see that what hair I have
is white in these days.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then also, pious Miramon Lluagor, it is well
known, converted many hundreds of the heathen about
Vraidex, by the great miracle which he wrought when
Koshchei the Deathless, and Toupan, the Duke of
Chaos, and Moloch, Lord of the Land of Tears, and
Nergal, the Chief of Satan’s Secret Police,—and several
thousand other powers of evil whose names and
infernal degrees at this instant evade me,—came swarming
out of hell in the form of gigantic bees.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is known that such favor was vouchsafed by
Heaven to the faith and the prayers of Miramon. Ninzian,
indeed, was present at the time, and told me
about those awful insects. Each was about as large
as a cow, but their language was much worse. Nevertheless—”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Jurgen was nowhere near done. “Then Guivric,”
he pointed out,—“Guivric of Perdigon, also, in
whom the old leaven stayed longer than in the others,
so that for a while he kept some little faults, they say,
in the way of pride and selfishness,—Guivric got
wholly rid of these blemishes after his notable trip
into the East to discomfit single-handed the signal
schisms of the pernicious and sinister Sylan. There
was never a sweeter nor a more prodigally generous
nor a more generally lovable saint upon earth than all
found Guivric after his return from exorcising that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>heathen heresiarch into a mere pile of bones; and so
the dear old Heitman stayed up to the glorious hour
of his seraphic death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is true. I recall the change in Guivric, and it
was most edifying.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you recall, also, madame, how the venerable
Kerin went down to teach the truth about the Redeemer
in the deepest fastnesses of error and delusion!
and how he there confuted, one by one, the frivolous
scientific objections of the overseers of hell,—with a
patience, a painstakingness and a particularity surprising
even in an apostle,—in an argument which lasted
twenty years!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That also is true. In fact, it was his own wife
who told me about it. Nevertheless—”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Jurgen was still talking. “Lastly, madame, my
beloved father Coth, as a matter of equally general
knowledge, went as an evangelist among the brown-skinned
and black-hearted unbelievers of Tollan. He
introduced among them the amenities of civilization
and true religion. He taught them to cover their savage
nakedness. And, in just the manner of holy Gonfal,
Coth likewise subdued the goad of carnal desire and the
prick of his flesh—not once, but many times,—when
Coth also was tempted by such an ill-regulated princess
as but to think of crimsons the cheek of decency.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Countess said, meditatively: “You and your
cheek—However, do you go on!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>Jurgen now shook a grizzled head, in rather shocked
deprecation. “You ask the impossible. Upon the innumerable
other pious exploits of Coth, I, as his
wholly unworthy son, may not dwell without appearing
vainglorious. That would be most unbecoming.
For the modesty of my father was such, madame, that,
I must tell you, not even to me, his own son, did he
ever speak of these matters. The modesty of my father
was such that—as was lately revealed to a devout
person in a vision,—even now my father esteems himself
unworthy of celestial bliss; even now his conscience
troubles him as to the peccadilloes of his earlier and
unregenerate days; and even now he elects to remain
among what, in a manner of speaking, might be termed
the less comfortable conditions of eternal life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is privileged, no doubt, to follow his own choice:
for his consecrated labors are attested. Nevertheless....”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then for a while Dame Niafer considered. These
certainly were the facts as to the lords of the Silver
Stallion, whom she herself could remember as having
been, in the far-off days of her youth, comparatively
imperfect persons: these acts of the apostles were facts
recorded in the best-thought-of chronicles, these were
the facts familiar even to children, facts which now a
lengthy while ago, along with many other edifying
facts about the saintly lords of the Silver Stallion, had
each been fitted into its proper niche as a part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>great legend of Manuel: and as she appraised these
facts, the old Countess validly perceived the strength
of Jurgen’s argument....</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” Niafer conceded, by and by, “yes, what you
say is true. These consecrated persons had faults when
they were first chosen by my husband to be his companions:
but through their intimacy with him, and
through the force of his example, they were purged
of these faults, they were made just and perfect: and
after the Redeemer’s passing, they fared stainlessly,
and were his apostles, and carried that faith which
his living had taught them into every direction and
about all quarters of the earth. These are the facts recorded
in each history book.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So, you perceive, Centurion dear! I can but repeat
that, in the axiom favored by my honored father,
every tree must be judged by its fruits. The exploits
of the Fellowship of the Silver Stallion I estimate as
the first fruits of the cult of the Redeemer. Men of
the somewhat lax principles to which these apostles in
their younger days—I say it in the proper spirit,
madame,—did now and then, we know, succumb, such
men are not unmiraculously made just and perfect. I
deduce we may declare this cult of Manuel the Redeemer
to be a heavenly inspired and an in all ways
admirable cult, since it produces miraculously, from
the raw material of alloyed humanity, such apostles.
This cult has already, in the holy lives and the high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>endings of the lords of the Silver Stallion, madame,
passed the pragmatic test: it is a cult that works.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Besides,” said Niafer, with a not unfeminine ellipsis,
and with a feminine preference for something
quite tangible, “there is that last sight of my husband’s
entry into glory, which as a child you had upon
Upper Morven, and the fearful eucharist which you
witnessed there. I could never understand why there
was not even one angel present, when as many as seven
came for Donander. Even so, you did witness very
holy and supernatural occurrences with which Heaven
would never have graced the passing of an ordinary
person.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The imagination of a child—” began Jurgen. He
stopped short. He added, “Very certainly, madame,
your logic is acute, and your deduction is unassailable
by me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“At all events—” Then it was Niafer who stopped
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c005'>But in a while she continued speaking, and in her
withered face was much that puzzled and baffled look
which Coth’s old face had worn toward the end.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At all events, it was only a dream about those hussies.
And at all events, it is near time for dinner,”
said Dame Niafer. “And people must have both their
dreams and their dinners in this world, and when we
go out of it we must take what we find. That is all.
I have not the imagination of a child. I am old. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>when you get old it is better not to imagine things.
It is better for an old person not to have any dreams.
It is better for an old person not to think. Only one
thing is good for an old person, and gives to that old
person an end of loneliness and of bad dreams and of
too much thinking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Niafer arose, not without difficulty; and the bent,
limping, very aged Countess Dowager of Poictesme
now went away from Jurgen, slowly and moodily.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c029'>JURGEN, thus left alone, forthwith ascended the
side of the great tomb. He stood now at the top
of it, holding to the neck of the horse upon which
sat the sculptured effigy of Manuel. The stone face,
above and looking beyond Jurgen, when seen at such
close quarters, was blotched and grotesquely coarse, the
blank eyeballs gave it a repellent air of crass idiocy.
But Jurgen was there to appraise not the face but the
garments of the overtowering hero, and it was at the
gems with which this famous effigy was inset that
Jurgen was really looking.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, without any deep surprise, Jurgen whistled.
To his trained eye it was apparent enough that these
gems with which Madame Niafer had prodigally
adorned her husband’s statue were one and all, and had
been from the first, bright bits of variously colored
glass. The Countess Radegonde, it appeared, had been
by a great many years forestalled in her economics and
in her practical view of this tomb by the countess who
builded it.</p>

<p class='c005'>And somehow Jurgen was not much surprised. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>only verbal outbreak was to utter one of his favorite
remarks. He said, “These women!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He climbed down to the pavement afterward, with
the gingerly care befitting a person of forty-and-something.
He cocked his gray head, looking upward with
a remarkable blending of the quizzical and of the regretful.
Now, seen at an appropriate distance, now Manuel
of Poictesme appeared again resplendent and in
everything majestic. He sat there, wary and confident
and superb, it seemed, perpetually to guard the
country which he had redeemed; and to which, men
said, he was to return....</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus Jurgen waited for some while, regarding the
vast tomb which was wholly empty, and which everywhere
was adorned with a worthless tinsel glitter, and
which yet stayed the most holy and, precisely as Jurgen
had pointed out, the actually inspiring shrine of
the heroic cult of the Redeemer....</p>

<p class='c005'>Jurgen opened his mouth. Then he shut it.</p>

<p class='c005'>For Jurgen recalled that only last month he had become
involved in a somewhat perturbing experience,
on account of having spoken extempore in praise of the
Devil; and so, as concerned the Redeemer, Jurgen decided
not to commit himself one way or the other. It
seemed the part of wisdom for an aging pawnbroker to
keep out of all such extra-mundane affairs.... Even
so, a carnival of thoughts now tempted him to play
with them, because this was a paradoxical tomb about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>which, but for the promptings of discretion, one might
say a number of fine things. Those tinsel fripperies
were, to the eyes of a considerate person, worthy of a
reverence undemanded by mere diamonds, because of
the deeds which they had prompted: and this emptiness
was sacred because of the faith which people had put in
it. And that this glittering vacuity could, as a matter
of fact, work miracles was now fully attested: for it
had reduced Jurgen to silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>No: you could never, shruggingly, dismiss this tomb
as, upon the whole, a malefic fraud which emanated
only folly and intolerance and a persecution of the
short-sighted by the blind. That was, in fact, a relatively
unimportant aspect, in that it was an aspect
which need never trouble you personally, if you were
careful. And, at forty-and-something, you were careful.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile you knew the shining thing to have been,
also, the begetter of so much charity, and of forbearance,
and of bravery, and of self-denial,—and of its
devotees’ so strange, so troublingly incomprehensible,
contentment,—that it somewhat frightened Jurgen.
For Jurgen, but a moment ago, had been handling—perhaps—a
bit over-intimately that really dangerous
fountain-head of all the aspiring and fine standards
which the aging pawnbroker was used unfeignedly to
admire, with a vague, ever-present underthought as to
the disastrousness of acquiring them. It would, he felt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>be the very deuce if in business life one were ever to
find these notions on the wrong side of his counter....</p>

<p class='c005'>Esthetically it was, of course, delightful to regard
the preëminent manifesters of the Redeemer’s power
and sanctity, in those splendid lords of the Silver Stallion
about whom Jurgen had but now been talking.
It was an ennobling and a picturesque reflection that
humanity had once risen to such heights; that mere
mortal men had, through their faith in and their contact
with the great Redeemer, become purged of all
faults and carnal weaknesses, and had lived stainlessly,
and had even performed their salutary miracles whenever
such a course seemed requisite. Jurgen thought it
would be rather fun to work miracles. In any event,
it was pleasant, and it was non-committally uplifting,
just to think about the heroic saints of yesterday, and
to envy their lot in life and their assured fine place in
history.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jurgen thought, for example, of gentle and great-hearted
old Guivric sharing his worldly wealth in such
noble irrationality with all needy persons; and of kneeling
Miramon with those seven thousand horrific bees
swarming about him,—screeching out infernal threats,
but powerless to trouble the serene, psalm-singing and
unstung saint. Jurgen thought of Kerin facing so intrepidly
yet other hideous cohorts of disputatious
fiends and cowing their science so-called with decisive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Biblical texts; and of the noble shocked figure of virtuous
Gonfal holding fast his nightgown about him
with one hand, and with the other repulsing the enamored—and,
they said, quite good-looking also,—Queen
Morvyth of the Isles of Wonder, when she assaulted
his chastity. Performances like these were well worthy
to be commemorated in history: and Jurgen regarded
them with a warm, gratifying thrill of purely esthetic
appreciation.</p>

<p class='c005'>For, from any practical standpoint, Jurgen obscurely
felt, it would be inconvenient to be quite as perfect
and superb as all that. Or, you might put it better,
perhaps, that this was not a condition which a really
honorable person, with a shop and a wife and other
obligations, could conscientiously do anything directly
to provoke for himself. Any, as one might say, defenseless
householder whom the all-powerful Redeemer
had explicitly and unarguably singled out to live in
the heroic sanctity of an apostle would be, of course, in
quite another and wholly justifiable case....</p>

<p class='c005'>And Jurgen was wondering what it was that the
child who Jurgen once had been had, actually, witnessed
and heard upon Upper Morven. He could not
now be certain: the fancies of a child are so unaccountable,
so opulent in decorative additions.... Yet
the testimony of that child appeared to have done
more than anything else toward establishing Dom Manuel’s
supremacy over all the men that Poictesme had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>ever known; indeed, when every fostering influence was
allowed for, the whole cult of the returning Redeemer
had begun with the testimony of that child. And perhaps
it was natural enough (in this truly curious
world) that Jurgen nowadays should be the only person
remaining in any place who was a bit dubious as
to the testimony of that child....</p>

<p class='c005'>Anyhow, young Jurgen had brought down from
Morven a most helpful and inspiring prediction which
kept up people’s spirits in this truly curious world; and
cheerfulness was a clear gain. The fact that nothing
anywhere entitled you to it could only, he deduced,
make of this cheerfulness a still clearer gain....</p>

<p class='c005'>There might, besides, very well have been something
to build upon. Modesty, indeed, here raised the point
if Jurgen—at that tender age and some while before
the full ripening of his powers,—could have invented
out of the whole cloth anything quite so splendid and
far-reaching? And that question he modestly left unanswered.
Meanwhile (among so many perplexities)
it was certain that Poictesme, along with the rest of
Christendom, had now its wholly satisfactory faith and
its beneficent legend.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
